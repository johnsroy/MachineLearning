Changed duplicate keys ঈ and ঠ for Probhat layout. The current version of Probhat keybpard of Indic-Keyboard contains 'ধ ঊ ঈ ঈ ঠ ঠ উ ই ঔ ফ', which should be 'ধ ঊ ঈ ড় ঠ ঐ উ ই ঔ ফ'. Key for ড় and ঐ was missing. I replaced the duplicate keys with the missing keys.

Take a look at the official site of Probhat layout. http://ekushey.org/?page/probhat_layout
