Handling server errors (500 errors) in iOS app. Also cancelling requests if switching to a new feed before old feed comes back.
Adding an Everything folder name to iOS app. Kinda ugly, kinda beautiful.

Getting IE9 working with OPML ajax upload.
Typo on never_cache after json view. Doh.
Fixing the living crap out of IE9. Everything works excellently now.
Upgrading jQuery 1.7.1 to 1.7.2 and upgrading bootstrap's carousel to 2.0.5.
Adding _gaq for debug, when analytics aren't present.
Taking @mgeraci's suggestion and moving the Starred! message to the opposite gravity of the story titles pane.
Double clicking sites and stories now works. Thanks to @ojiikun for figuring this one out.
Fixing scroll/paging bug where the wrong story would be selected. Technically it's not fixed, but the indicator is now always present, so you know why it's happening. Thanks to @afita for the thorough investigation.
Lots of little bugs: avatar images, icon importer, page importer, adding analytics tracking to intro.
Fixing following bug due to array truncation of following list.
Small tweaks to blurblogs. iPadifying blurblogs.
Adding /social/activities endpoint for Android and iOS.
Fixing bug when a story changes its guid (like on a tumblr rename), but it still thinks it has comments. Forcing each story to recount its comments if comments are claimed, just in case.
Showing social service fetch status in real-time (actually polling every 3 seconds) in both intro and friends dialogs.
Fixing issue in social connecting to Twitter/FB in popup.
Google Analytics on Blurblogs.
Trying to outwit IE by adding in a fake console.
console.log -> NEWSBLUR.log
Adding sync status and tasking facebook/twitter friend imports.

Moving read date to use shared date.
Adding signup activity for iPad and web.
Adding monit for celery on db. Fixing push subscription issue with changing feed ids.
Adding narrow view for Feed view.
Adding gray icons for twitter/facebook crossposting shares.
Fixing shared_date for @secretsquirrel. Was inappropriately being converted to plain text date only for stories the user shared themselves.
Removing RankExploits from the Original site view.
Removing RankExploits from the Original site view.
Fixing bug for anonymous users on blurblogs.
Showing comment boxes in all the right places on blurblogs.
Probably a bit too much in one commit: allowing categories to be specified in interactions and activities calls so the iPad won't get category types it doesn't know how to handle. Also added twitter/facebook buttons to comment share on blurblogs.
Moving buttons and resurfacing recommended site.
Typo on the about page. Thanks to @theprawn for pointing it out.
Fixing a profile bug for new users so their social profile comes through.

The '$(<FILE)' syntax expands to a single line, separating the lines of FILE by
spaces. This works on recent shells (means: not dash, busybox sh).
For more backward compability one could use '$(cat FILE)' or even '`cat FILE`'.

The new requirement.txt includes all optional dependencies (taken straight from
fabfile.py) and misses gunicorn and psycopgs2, as those are installed
separately by fabric.
(Better getting fast 90% of packages and some superfluous ones than none at
all)

Moving from image_url -> image_urls in iOS app as well.
Mark read up/down icons.
image_url -> image_urls
Fixing progress in image caching.
Fixing crash when missing cached image.
Reading cached images and using in stories. A single iamge is nowhere near enough. Need a refactor to account for all images.
Fixing image cache notifier message for date of last download.
Caching images for offline. Progress bar works, but the message is wrong.
Fixing loading indicators blue-ness.
Setting the stage for caching images. Just need the cache writer and cache reader.
Refactoring order and read_filter. Global preferences!
Adding new preferences modal.
Handling edge case of reading a story on the web, syncing with ios, then reading in ios offline should mark the story as read through syncing, overriding offline cache.
Correct notifications for offline and on.
Full offline. Adding feeds table and caching of feed list by username. Also optimizing unread story fetching by placing all db calls in a background thread.

Fixing new uiactivities for ipad.
v2.4.1 of iOS app, ready for enterprise distribution.
Preference to hide public comments on iOS. Ready to ship for beta testing!
Removing debugging.
Fixing send to button on Original view. Now the two are finally linked together.
Fixing three bugs: proper caching of feed list in offline mode, fixing crash on loading feed when previously read stories, and stories showing up read in folders with an unread filter.
Adding new send to button to traversal bar. Now isntapaper is 2 clicks.
Fixing Pinboard images for use in preferences.
Adding Pinboard and Chrome.
Fixing Pocket.
Using native UIActivity. Readability and Pocket don't work yet.
Fixing unread stories being overwritten in the inbetween time from offline to online when loading stories.
Refactor sync service task types to use enums.
Refactor result codes for SyncService into enums. Remove deleteFeed from SyncService in preference to standard API call.
Switch all mark-read ops to new API using story_hash.
Fixing timestamp issue on image order.
Lots of offline progress: cancelling sync in the middle of one correctly, fixing bug around missing story hashes in sync, updating progress bar more often, fixing image caching bug that preventing caching from running at all.
Fixing Dilbert-specific encoding error.
Adding logging to profile views.
Fixing encoding on Original pages. Thanks @bruceyou for the wonderful help!

Lets the menu table views do their own height calculations and makes the bottom vertical inset match the top (negative) to avoid extra white space at the bottom of the popover.

keyboard input from leaking through to an underlying view controller.
Without this, it can be confusing as, for example, you can navigate to a
different story while you’ve got a ‘mark read’ popover shown for another
story.
