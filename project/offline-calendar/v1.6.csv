Although the ActionBar is available from API level 11 onwards, the
getThemedContext() call is not available until API 14, causing the
crash reported in issue #30. This is a fatal build error with newer
SDKs (which now have the method marked as level 14 correctly).

Fortunately, the ActionBar can also inflate a view from a resource
id so we don't have to ask it for the inflator. We can get the inflated
view back to manipulate it, avoiding the use of getThemedContext()
entirely.

With a bit of refactoring, the code ends up simpler despite having to
do things this way.
