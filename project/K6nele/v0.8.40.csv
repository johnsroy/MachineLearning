which does not seem to accept the results from the recognizer,
probably expecting it to perform the web search itself.
Chrome specifies the extras 'WEB_SEARCH_ONLY' and 'LANGUAGE_MODEL'='web_search',
but sets the action to 'RECOGNIZE_SPEECH' (rather than 'WEB_SEARCH'),
so maybe it's a bug in Chrome.
