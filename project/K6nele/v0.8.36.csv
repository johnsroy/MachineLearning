and send it to the server if EXTRA_LANGUAGE is not set.
Some keyboard apps prefer to set 'selectedLanguage' instead of
EXTRA_LANGUAGE.

Other changes:

- communicate the value of EXTRA_PARTIAL_RESULTS to the server
- fix regression from previous commit (results sometimes not returned)
- more logging

Reverted the behaviour introduced in commit eb67b12037f42dab.
This is not backwards compatible with
situations where people use a non-Estonian locale
and an app that does not explicitly set the input language.
