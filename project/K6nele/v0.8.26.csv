Apps like iris and Dolphin Browser use the speech recognizer
via RecognitionService and nicely set the EXTRA_CALLING_PACKAGE.
K6nele ignored it and instead tried to identify these apps via
the undocumented embedded 'packageName' extra that the keyboard apps
usually set, but in the case of non-keyboard apps it is usually not set.

Otherwise minor cleanup.
