SelectCalendarsActivity:
-fixed onItemClickListener() not working on calendar listview
-fixed calenders in the listview being clickable even if all calendars are set to be synced
-implemented AlertDialog to select ringer for specific calendars

MainActivity:
-updated getRingerIcon() to return a colorized icon to show whether ringer state is from default settings (ugly red), event series settings (ugly green), calendar settings (ugly blue), or event instance settings (basic grey)
-icons still not reflecting colors from event series properly, likely due to all database rows of event series being updated with new event ringer type (this should only be stored in preferences)

EventSilencerService:
-now properly includes calendar and event series settings when determining whether an event should be ignored
-now properly finds the best ringer to use (default < calendar < event series < event instance) fixes #13

EventDetailsFragment:
-applying a ringer to an event series now removes all custom ringers from the local database before writing to preferences, fixes #14
-slightly better layout (more padding, adding icons to event title and calendar name
-checkbox to save setting for all instances only visible if there are more than one instance of the event
-clear button only visible if the event instance has a custom ringer or if the event series has a custom ringer set

Columns, DatabaseInterface, EventDatabaseOpenHelper, SimpleCalendarEvent:
-removed logic for custom ringer.  Events now only store their specific instance ringer, preferences must be queried to determine whether a calendar or event series specific ringer has been applied

build.gradle, Versioning:
-debug builds now clearly marked as pre-release debug builds (with build date)

MainActivity:
-displays separate error if no calendars have been selected to be synced
-updated colors used for ringer icons:
default - light grey
calendar - blue grey
event series - green grey
event instance - dark grey

SelectCalendarsActivity:
-redesigned list layout (text is still overlapping icons on right side if the calendar name is too long)
-clear button is only visible if the calendar has a previous setting applied
-checkbox used instead of changing the list items background color

SettingsActivity:
-removed sliders for media and alarm volumes, toggling either checkbox will now totally silence the media and/or alarm volumes during an event

VolumesManager:
-current media and alarm volumes are stored in preferences before the channels are silenced and are restored after the event ends

Prefs:
-removed methods related to the variable alarm and media volumes
-added methods to store and retrieve media and alarm volumes

-added broadcast receiver to be notified when one tooltip is dismissed (so that all tooltips can be dismissed together)

ShowUpdatesActivity:
-updates dialog is only shown if not on first run

TooltipManager:
-added manager to simplify sending broadcasts when a tooltip has been dismissed

Prefs:
-added methods to get and set first run status
