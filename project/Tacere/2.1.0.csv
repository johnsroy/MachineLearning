DatabaseInterface:
-uses value attached to lookahead enum during update()

AlarmManagerWrapper:
-added null check for context in constructor
-removed check for time < 0 in scheduleAlarmAt(), the alarm manager takes negative values fine

ShowUpdatesActivity:
-added null context check to showUpdatesDialogIfNeeded()
-showUpdatesDialogIfNeeded() will hide the updates dialog for the current version if this was the first run

MainActivity:
-refactored datasetChangedReceiver:
-no longer uses Parcelable (was generating a large number of errors about enums not being serializable)
-fixed possible bug where database could be emptied while the main view was still visible, which would result in an empty list being shown, instead of an error message
-notifiyDataSetChanged() is only called if the datasetChangedReceiver does not know the specific row that was updated
-if intent has row Id attached, then only that row will be updated
-showFirstRunWizardIfNeeded() moved from onStart() to onCreate()
-removed DateConverter from setupErrorMessage() since the Intervals enum has strings already attached

EventDetailsFragment:
-uses datasetManager to send notifications
-colored positive button text to accent color

AdvancedSettingsFragment:
-colored positive button text to accent color

EventListItem:
-extends LinearLayout
-fills in view with default event provided by EventInstance.getBlankEvent();
-can be passed specific EventInstance to display
-event can optionally be specified as active or future, if neither specified, will use event date and ActiveEventManager to guess

EventInstance:
-added getBlankEvent() to return a generic event

EventCursorAdapter:
-removed use of EventListItemInflator, now passes event to EventListItem for view creation
-list_item_event.xml now just has a single EventListItem view

TutorialEventListFragment:
-removed hardcoded event list items from view, now uses EventListItem to generate view dynamically
