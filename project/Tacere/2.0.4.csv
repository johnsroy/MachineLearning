-many updates included that were not commited before
-refactored coded into multiple packages for better organization
-lots of small refactoring for more readable code

MainActivity.java:
-all events that will trigger silencing show an icon in the list now
-events with custom ringers set have icon colorized to match the event color
-events that will not trigger silencing (all day events or events marked as available) will not show an icon, unless a custom ringer has been set

PollService.java:
-silencing now takes into account whether or not an activity has a custom ringer set (events that would not normally silence will now do so)

AboutActivity.java:
-added icon in action bar to show updates
