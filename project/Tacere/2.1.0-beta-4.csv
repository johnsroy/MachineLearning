EventLongclickActivity:
-basic dialog to show current state of event instance
-still buggly

MainActivity:
-added instance variable to control animation duration
-reduced animation duration

DatabaseInterface:
-added getCalendarNameForId() to get the name of a calendar based on its id

-replaced EventLongclickActivity with EventLongclickFragment

EventLongclickFragment:
-using DialogFragment instead of activity
-simplified layout to reduce buttons to 'clear' and 'ok'
-reduced size to wrap_content instead of fill_parent
-correctly saves default event ringers to preferences
-TODO still needs to overwrite settings for all instances in the local database

DatabaseInterface:
-added error checking to setRingerType() (fixes #9)

Prefs:
-added methods to store/retrieve map of Integer->Integer to/from shared preferences
-added getRingerForEventSeries() to return saved ringer for a series of event instances
-added setRingerForEventSeries() to store a specific ringer for an event series
-added unsetRingerTypeForEventSeries() to clear saved ringer for the given event series

EventSilencerService:
-getBestRingerType() now prioritizes ringers as: generic default ringer < calendar specific ringer < event series ringer < instance ringer (calender support not yet added

-renamed EventLongclickFragment to EventDetailsFragment
-changed sidebar image to be 30% uglier

EventDetailsFragment:
-added calls to database interface to set ringer type for all events in series when saving settings

MainActivity:
-added method getBestRingerForInstance() to return the ringer that should be used for the given event (code duplicate of method from EventSilencerService, this should be moved to a separate class to eliminate duplication)
-added method eventHasCustomRinger() so we know which color to apply to the best ringer

DatabaseInterface:
-added setRingerForAllInstanceOfEvent()  //TODO this could be sped up quite a bit by using an embedded SQL update

-added DataSetManager

EventDetailsFragment:
-fixed bug  where context could sometimes be null
-removed some duplicated code

MainActivity:
-broadcast receiver now only restarts the event silencer service if the service was not the one to send the message
-no longer handles finding best ringer for given event.  This is handled during the database update only

SimpleCalendarEvent
-added member to indicate whether the event has a custom ringer set (this was needed since the default value of UNDEFINED can also be considered custom)

Columns:
-added column for CUSTOM_RINGER

DatabaseInterface:
-setRingerType() now also sets CUSTOM_RINGER to true
-setRingerForAllInstancesOfEvent() now uses the faster update() to avoid looping through unrelated events
-getEvent() updated to read in custom ringer field
-getEvent() now applies custom ringer from calendar preferences and event series preferences (if they exist)
-simplified if/elses in insertEvent() to ternary operators

DataSetManager:
-added to reduce code duplication
-handles sending broadcast messages to indicate when the database has been updated

EventDatabaseOpenHelper:
-onUpgrade() will now drop any existing event table and recreate it.
-This should probably be changed later so that upgrades from the 2.0.x series can be migrated in without losing any custom data

Prefs:
-added stub method getRingerForCalendar(), only returns UNDEFINED ringer for now
-removed unused getDefaultRinger()

EventSilencerService:
-removed getBestRingerType(), best ringer is either the generic default, or the value stored in the event (custom calendar and event series ringers are applied during database update)
-removed duplicate code to send data set changed broadcast message

EventDetailsFragment

-using string resources instead of hardcoded string values
