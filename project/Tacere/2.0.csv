PollService:
-will now refresh when the calendar is updated (through PROVIDER_CHANGED broadcast intent from the calendar [reliability seems spotty])
-keeps track of its state within the SharedPreferences: 'notActive', 'eventActive', 'quickSilent'
-recognizes when it has been woken after boot to clear the saved sate

QuickSilenceProvider:
-first attempt at a homescreen quick silence widget, still does not work correctly

Activity Settings and Activity Advanced Settings:
-cleaned up interface a bit

PollService:
-nextEvent() returns the first event in the next 24 hrs matching user preferences (free time & availability)
-onHandleIntent() checks whether an event is active based on the returned events begin time, schedules a wake at the events end time.
-takes into account buffer minutes for begin
BUG: does not use buffer minutes with end time

PollServiceReceiver:
-renamed to BootCompletedReceiver

-MainActivity and PollService now access events through DatabaseInterface
-DatabaseInterface provides an abstracted interface to EventProvider
-EventProvider exposes the local SQLite database of calendar events
-many changes, events in MainActivity can have specific ringer types set
-each calendar event is tied to a specific instance.  This means that reoccuring events can have different ringers for each occurance
-blank icon is used to indicate that the event has no specific ringer set and that default will be used
-tap event to cycle ringer types
-long press event to reset to default ringer

Known Bugs
-trailing buffer seems to be ignored
-icons need to be updated
