Added a first unit test for the CardGenerator class. It currently only contains
one test case for generating a virtual nPA.

In order to use this test some changes to the TravisCI configuration are
required. Especially the OpenPACE python bindings need to be build before
vsmartcard is being tested since the vsmartcard nPA functions use these
bindings.

Make sure that the file gets closed when writing a card to/reading a
card from disk. Also add a unit test for the error condition when trying
to import a card from a nonexistent file.

Commit 8ea1c74e2f0f707bf8f80947dab5a23495f9607a moved the f.close()
statement to the wrong indention level, thereby closing the file
prematurely when reading Datagroups from a file. Since files are closed
automatically due to the with statement, we just remove the explicit
call to close().

There are now tests for most currently implemented card types. Tests for
new card types can easily be added by inheriting from the basic test
class. The ePass card type is currently missing from the tests because
the CardGenerator for this class currently only works with user
interaction.
