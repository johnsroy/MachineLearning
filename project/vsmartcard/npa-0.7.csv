On SLES SP3 the automake tool has Version 1.10.1 and it does not know the new introducted AM_COND_IF macro.
I found the related work around on Mailing list of automake from year 2009
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/automake/2009-01/msg00011.html
since AM_COND_IF is not available in old Versions, the way is to use simple shell if statements as done in your configure.ac several times.
