Converted the entire app from pure html and javascript to a native webview wrapper, much better experience.
Need to add countries and states dropdown list in the future. Didn't have enough time currently to convert the functionality.
App now runs off of local html and javascript so is no longer dependent on addresstogps.com. This helps with both speed and security.
Changed user agent to chrome on windows 7.
