- Ported GlowPadView and helper classes over to clock app.  Framework version
relies on a couple hidden api's so there are minor changes to the code.
- Added necessary drawables to support slider.
- Updated proguard flags so that introspected animation methods are not
stripped from slider widget.
- Changed lock screen view to be consistent with normal activity since existing
landscape width is not wide enough to hold new layout. Removed the need for
AlarmAlert. Using only AlarmAlertFullScreen now.

Fetching a Ringtone object causes a media player to be instantiated for each

in the alarm list to stutter. Fix by caching ringtone when alarm is expanded

Normally activities are destroyed and re-created during an orientation change.
But many of the existing alarm activities have configChanges set in the
AndroidManifest file. This causes the framework to re-size instead of
re-creating the activity on orientation change. In turn, this prevents the
properly layouts and styles from being applied even though there are size
specific resources.

This caused a problem where the dialogs were too big after rotating from
portrait to landscape. Fixed the problem by removing configChanges and properly
handling orientation changes.

This is a re-addition of something that was previously added and then removed:
I65be41b889446ae7232488bfc2809bd2add93f6f

- Ported GlowPadView and helper classes over to clock app.  Framework version
relies on a couple hidden api's so there are minor changes to the code.
- Added necessary drawables to support slider.
- Added special paddings for 7' and 10' tablet.
