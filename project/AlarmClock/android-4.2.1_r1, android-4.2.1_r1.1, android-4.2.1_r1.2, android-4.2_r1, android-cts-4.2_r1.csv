bug: 7511464
Added intents to listen to TIME_TICK, time changes and screen on in order to update the
next alarm info and the city's day in the alarm clock.
Listening to to TIME_TICK is not needed for the clock but it is needed to update
the day in the world clock when the time passes midnight in a selected city.
