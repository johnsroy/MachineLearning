Add a save and cancel bar at the bottom similar to the contacts application.

the user must hit 'save' to save the changes.

Update AlarmPreference and RepeatPreference to manage their own summary instead
of having callbacks. When saving the alarm, retrieve all the values from the
preference widgets.

Make each preference non-persistent to avoid saving them to the shared
preferences.

In order to get the save/cancel buttons flush on the bottom, I have to undo
what the PreferenceActivity does in onCreate. I then build my own LinearLayout
to hold the ListView and the two buttons.

"d776e51cec79901a0d656bba7b1f3780cceac57d","2009-06-26 14:52:56-04:00","Huge rewrite of the AlarmClock to play the Alarm in a service.

The AlarmKlaxon has been converted to a service that plays the alarm and
vibrates the device. The AlarmAlert now just shows the UI for the alarm and
allows the user to snooze or dismiss the alarm. The snooze button must be
pressed in order to snooze the alarm. Volume and Camera buttons dismiss the
alarm while other buttons have their original behavior.

Each alarm triggers a notification that the alarm has fired. This allows another
activity (say, the Calendar alert #1908616) to play on top of the AlarmAlert.
The AlarmKlaxon service will continue to play even though the alert has been
dismissed. The user can get back to the UI through the notification.

If the user snoozes the alarm, the notification reflects that choice (#1691034)
and allows the user to cancel the snooze by clicking the notification. The
snoozed alarm takes priority over any other alarm (#1693155) so that it will
play unless the notification is clicked.

The database interaction has also been rewritten to use a Parcelable Alarm class
for sending and receiving the alarm data in a much simpler manner. This allows
for fewer database lookups since each activity no longer has to lookup the alarm
info.

The alarm silenced text has been removed from the AlarmAlert UI and moved to the
notification area. When an alarm is killed, the alert is dismissed and the
notification reflects the state. Clicking the notification launches the SetAlarm
activity so the user can see which alarm was killed.

...and can't see Dismiss and Snooze button if the device is on dock

Change-Id: Ib76b54f0a65930e142a3da1e1152f70d7f3ad3c7
Explanation: only the fullscreen alarm activity had the flags set to turn on
the screen and dismiss the lock screen.  The app picks whether to show
that one or the non-fullscreen one based on whether device is currently
locked, which is correct, but with the introduction of docks, locked
!= screen off.  In particular, the desk dock keeps the keyguard dismissed
while the device is in it.

The fix is to just set these flags for both alert activities.  That seems
generally right for many reasons.

Now pulls high and low temperatures, as well as an icon (in
the form of a drawable resource), from the Genie widget,
periodically.  Known issues: artwork is mdpi and fuzzy (bug
in Genie).

Preliminary support for a new screen-saving mode (subject to
change) specifically for OLEDs with short B/R subpixel
lifetime.  Text is drawn in green on a black background; the
text also randomly jumps around the screen. Any user input
(touch, trackball/keypress, etc.) will restore the previous
view.

Screen saver mode kicks in after a delay (or, for debugging,
a longpress on 'Dim').  Honors the current dimness setting,
so if the clock is currently in nightstand mode, the screen
saver will be very dim; otherwise (viz., desk mode) the
saver will be brighter.
