Colors and text sizes are exactly how Jeff specified in the pdf. I tried to
match the size of everything based on looks but I might be a little off in
padding. The shadow effect on the bottom clock has been left out for now since
there are no specifics in the spec for each of the shadow components and I
cannot figure it out based on the drawing.

- Force the weather widget to actually fetch new data at
the moment the device is docked, or when the screensaver
disappears (if the device is plugged in).
- Use Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP to launch weather,
music, and gallery to avoid jumping into the middle of
their task stacks (http://b/2267831)
- Fix layout issues with weather, particularly when the
Genie widget is unavailable. (relates to
http://b/2254472)
- Internationalize the error message shown when Genie
malfunctions.
- Clean up weather & time displays to match UX specs more
closely (fonts, shadow crop issues).
- Remove some tabs in XML.
- Internal cleanup: use 'query' in the name of functions &
variables related to getting updated weather from Genie;
use 'fetch' to refer to downloading new weather data from
the network

The original request was for just a few of the ringtones but that really isn't
possible with the current framework. Media files are classified by what folder
they are transferred to during the build. It would be nice to have a way to
specify what media files should be allowed in the list of ringtones but for now,
I think it is ok to allow selecting any of the built-in ringtones.

When placed into night mode (dim mode), the DeskClock must
restore full brightness any time the user returns to it from
another activity. There are two reasons for this:

1. The other activity won't be dim, so it's sort of jarring
to return to an almost-black screen.

2. As indicated in bug 2305223, visiting another activity is
a useful way to restore the display if it's so dark that
you can't see it to find the nightmode toggle button
(e.g., ambient lighting is very bright).

In other words: if the clock is behaving like a dock app
(launched by a dock event), it should finish() when the
device is removed from the dock.  If, on the other hand,
it's behaving like a regular app (launched from the
Launcher), it should ignore an un-dock event.

This change also removes support for entering the desk dock
via a dialer code (an unnecessary feature since the app can
always be invoked from the Launcher).
