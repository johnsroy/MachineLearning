This change allows the user to create a new alarm and then press 'Revert'
without having already created the alarm.

Refactor a few methods to take an Alarm object rather than all the alarm fields.
The static method in AlarmClock to create a new alarm is no longer needed. Do
some cleanup in AlarmProvider around intial values.
