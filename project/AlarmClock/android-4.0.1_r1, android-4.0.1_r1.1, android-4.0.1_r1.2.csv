Essentially a duplicate of the moving-clock screensaver
introduced with Nexus One, but in a convenient Dream

* Snooze and Dismiss are now stacked vertically, which
should make it easier to remember the order in which they
appear if you don't have your glasses on and can't read
them.

* The hit rectangle for Snooze now encompasses the top 75%
of the alert, including the time, perfect for the wild
flailing of the half-asleep user.

* Additionally, the larger Snooze means it's easier to hit
(read: Dismiss is harder to accidentally hit) even if the
display is rotated in a way you're not expecting (as in
bug 1721234); just tap the middle of the dialog and you're
safe.

* Finally, the dialog is now a stable width, so that changes
in the time (displayed in a proportional font) don't cause
the window to change size.

The only way to turn on the screen is to have a fullscreen
theme; doing so disallows us access to the platform styles
for the alert/dialog themes, so this change pulls in a copy
of the correct background bitmap. (We are able, at least,
to use the Holo version of the fullscreen transparent theme,
which causes the buttons to have the correct appearance.)

There's now also a separate layout file for the fullscreen
case so we don't apply this new decoration when a proper
dialog is available to us (read: the screen was already
unlocked).

Finally, tweak AndroidClockTextView so Eclipse doesn't choke
on the layout files.

When calculating the next alarm event, make sure to take into

But, now that we allow for another alarm to happen while a previous
one was snoozed, we need to allow for multiple snoozed alarms.

Once we allow for multiple snoozed alarms, we need to be able to allow
for each to be canceled individually.

When the default alarm ringtone has been deleted, the alarm
pref can't resolve the ringtone URI and never finishes loading
a reasonable default string. In these cases, the Clock app
actually does play a default tone, so it's not necessary to
have the UI select a new tone, but it does need to show
something reasonable in the summary. Fix this in 3 ways:
* Do not resolve actual URI for a default URI when looking
up the title. This brings back the 'Default ringtone (xxx)'
string that used to appear in GB on individual alarms with
no specific ringtone selected.
* In the default alarm pref, we do still want to resolve an
actual URI since the 'Default ringtone' string would be
redundant. But when the default has been deleted, show a
reasonable default string by asking for the default alarm's
title without resolving to an actual URI. This does mean
the summary will show 'Default ringtone (xxx)' when a default
has been deleted, but it's better than nothing, and it's
consistent with individual alarms with unresolvable ringtones.
* If even the default URI fails to resolve to a string, at least
clear the 'Loading ringtone...' string. This generally will
not happen.

The clock is supposed to be sized to maximally fit the
available space, so there's no point in adjusting for the
user's font size preference.

This change also switches the AM/PM font back to the system
font (and not AndroidClock) to better match the stroke
weight of the numerals, consistent with the DeskClock
display.
