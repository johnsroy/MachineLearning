2) The current level in puzzle game mode is now saved more often to address the issue whereby players lose their level when the game crashes when their system is low on resources.  I believe this is really only an issue with low-end devices with limited memory.

3) I fixed a bug with the game paused banner not getting removed after a game is resumed with the game state getting restored from a bundle.

4) The green penquin sprite map was updated to make the sprites match the opponent actions in 2 player mode.

"8c497db38b2b47f422eed6a266bfbff7f9a4e449","2014-05-16 12:52:31+00:00","Added another check to the music player for proper memory allocation.  If there is insufficient memory to allocate a track buffer, the music player won't run.

Added an explicit call to System.gc() when the music player loads a new song, as garbage collection per the default Android heuristics was sometimes inadequate to meet the dynamic memory demands of the game, especially when completing many levels in very rapid succession.

Improved the efficiency of the network protocol significantly for WiFi multiplayer with improved handling of the timing of player status messages.
