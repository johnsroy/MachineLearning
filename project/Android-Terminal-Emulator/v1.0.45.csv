once-per-second polling has no effects other than wasting a little CPU
time in that case.  Instead, unconditionally poll for window size

The window title is logically a property of the terminal session, so
store it as a field in the TermSession object, which allows us to just
do session.getTitle() (modulo minor complications) in TermViewFlipper
and WindowListAdapter when we want the session title.  (In practice, we
also add a getTitle() to ShellTermSession which takes a default title
argument to use in case of the title being null or empty, and use that
instead.)

We do still need a notification interface for when the title changes,
but we no longer need to pass around the title, so use the existing
UpdateCallback interface for that.  Also, extend SessionList to offer a
pass-through title change notification interface, which makes the
implementation in WindowListAdapter easier.

Commit 7135a50... ('Fix rotation of colored text.') introduced checking
of color and formatting attributes as well as text when determining the
last printing character on a line.  However, the naive approach to doing
this results in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when the text in
question contains non-BMP characters or combining characters, because in
those cases, the char array will be longer than the color array.

Fix this by using the correct index into the color array, the screen
column of the character.
