The actionbar overlay show/hide works by swapping the main view
between two custom styles, Theme.Holo and Theme.Holo.ActionBarOverlay.

It turns out that action bar styles must show the window title,
otherwise the actionBar will be invisible and code that calls
getActionBar will get a null action bar.

The bug was that when I updated the custom themes to support Material
Design, I mistakenly changed the custom theme Theme.Holo to inherit
from the custom theme Theme, which hides the window title.

Hence, the window had a theme which hid the window title, and
getActionBar() returned null.

Fixed by undoing the earlier change of theme inheritance. Now the
custom Theme.Holo theme inherits from the system
android:style/Theme.Holo (as it did originally) and this means that
the code gets a non-null action bar, and the actionbar can be
shown/hidden again.

Fixes issue #409 'action bar issue'. Tested on emulator running
API level 19.

I'm going to leave the extra actionBar == null checks that people
added to work around this bug. They're harmless and will help in
case there's ever some other reason that actionBar is null.
