SecureRandom implementations shipped in Android before 4.4 suffer from
some notable weaknesses resulting in poor-quality entropy [1] [2].
While some vendors will have patched their systems, we cannot count on
patches being available or installed (sigh); instead, ship the
workarounds provided by Google in [3] (a new CSPRNG implementation that
reads from /dev/urandom, and proper seeding of the OpenSSL PRNG on
initialization).

earlier: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-7372
[2] Against Android 4.2 and 4.3's OpenSSL-derived PRNG:

separators

If TEA is started via a call to a remote interface that subsequently
fails (an invalid shortcut, for instance), the terminal foreground
service is left running despite no terminal sessions being open.  Fix
this by detecting this case in finish() and stopping the service.
