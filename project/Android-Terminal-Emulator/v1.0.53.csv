This was done using the command-line iconv tool:

iconv -f euc-kr -t utf-8 inputFile >outputFile

I believe EUC-KR is a popular character encoding used by Korean PCs.

UTF-8 is the character set used by Android for all languages. Therefore
we have to convert the EUC-KR characters into UTF-8 in order to work
properly on Android.

In the future we will have to be careful when editing these files. They
should be edited using a UTF-8 editor rather than a EUC-KR editor.
