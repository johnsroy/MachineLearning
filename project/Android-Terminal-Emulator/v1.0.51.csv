These files were all from the Gingerbread branch of CyanogenMod's version
of Android-Terminal-Emulator. They didn't have the latest strings, which
is a problem for Array items, because it means that some entries were
missing from the UI. (For example you couldn't pick large font sizes in
these languages.)

I added all the missing strings. In some cases I copied from a similar
language. In other cases I was able to guess at a translation based on the
text that was already in the file. And in other cases I just used the
original English thext.

Fixes unreported issue where pressing the 'Fn' key on a hardware
keyboard sent a ^@ character. Fn is a modifier key, so it shouldn't
send any key codes by itself.

Note that this 'Fn' key is a hardware key, typically used to control
whether Function keys send function codes or device-specific features.
Android Terminal Emulator also as the concept f a Fn key, used to allow
hardware phone keyboards to send extra characters, but that's unrelated
to this Fn key.)
