Switch to Alt-key-does-not-send-ESC mode.

This reverts commit fd719e10d6b542ebf0be28cb58bbda484c5834b7, reversing
changes made to 113d77e5fa711cfcdc50953b70a7df6803a467d8.

This change was reverted because it caused a regression in the way soft
keyboard modifier keys worked. (e.g. using the volume keys as control
keys.) I think the regression happened because the change introduced
multiple copies of TermKeyListener. There should be only one instance
of TermKeyListener for each terminal window.

I would still like the feature (of having Alt send Esc), but without the
regression to the soft keyboard.

Since an East Asian wide character takes two screen columns, if we're
inserting one into a spot previously occupied by a normal-width
character, we need to overwrite the contents of the column to the right
of the position into which the character is inserted.  We do this
shifting the contents of the rest of the line left in the array, then
updating our idea of the storage used -- or at least that's what's
supposed to happen.

There are at least two problems with the current implementation:

(1) findStartOfColumn() is used in a few places to get the spot in the
array where a column starts, but this relies on the offset array, which
is potentially out of date at this point.  Fix this by adding the shift
(which will be used to update the offset array later) to the value
whenever we use findStartOfColumn().
(2) When truncating the line by reducing the storage used count, we
currently effectively reduce the count by the size of the last column in
the line, which is not necessarily the same as the size of the
overwritten column.  We should instead adjust by the size of the
just-overwritten column (which is readily available to us at this
point).

Fixes #145, and potentially a class of other difficult-to-reproduce bugs
involving East Asian wide character support.

We currently discover a non-BMP character at the start or end of a

representing the character individually, resulting in off-by-one errors
in calculating the portion of the char array containing the run to be
drawn (we erroneously omit any high surrogate at the start of a run, and
erroneously include any high surrogate immediately following the end of
a run).

Fix this by processing both halves of the surrogate pair immediately
when we see the high surrogate.

I think for most users of Android Terminal emulator the default initial
command (which adds /data/local/bin to the path) was not useful,
because the directory /data/local/bin does not exist by default.

The /data/local directory is special because its permissions are set
so that it can be written to by the Android shell even on non-rooted
phones.

Therefore, it is possible for users of non-rooted phones to create the
/data/local/bin directory, and then put executables into that dir,
and then add it to their path, and then execute them as shell commands.

But, in reality, most people who would go to the trouble of installing
command-line applications tend to root their phone and set their
phone up more like a normal Linux system.

So there were very few people (possibly none) for which the default
initial command string was useful.

+ Treat the Meta key the same way as the Alt key.
- I considered having this be a separate preference, but
there's a flaw: Some keyboards such as the popular
Hacker's keyboard have a key labeled 'Alt' that actually
reports as 'Meta' in software.

So let's treat both Alt and Meta the same for now.

+ Make this code work on Android SDK 11+ physical keyboards

Android SDK 11+ physical keyboards are 'chording' as opposed to
'toggling'. Therefore we have to handle the !allowToggle case.

Also, the Meta flags can come in as a combination of
3 bits, so to mask them off we need to mask with META_ALT_MASK
rather than just META_ALT_ON.
