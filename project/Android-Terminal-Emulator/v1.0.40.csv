Our key event tracking probably won't ever work as well as the system
built into Android, so use Android's whenever possible (e.g. on API >= 5
devices).

This prevents us from incorrectly consuming a back key up event in the
following scenario on Android < 2.0:

(1) User presses back key down in the terminal activity
(2) While the back key is down, another activity moves to the top of our
task's back stack
(3) User releases the back key
(4) User presses the back key down again, returning focus to us
(5) User releases the back key

For TermPreferences, this prevents the title/action bar from reading
'Terminal Emulator', which will be confusing on Honeycomb and ICS once
(where the title will be much more prominent once we enable the action
bar).  This also allows us to remove the setTitle() call in WindowList's
onCreate() method.

A WIFI_MODE_FULL WifiLock does not prevent Android from enabling
power-saving measures which increase latency, decrease throughput, and
break multicast, all of which are frequently important to programs
running in the terminal which need the WifiLock.  Instead, on API 12 or
later, take a WIFI_MODE_FULL_HIGH_PERF WifiLock, which keeps the wifi
radio in the same state as when the system is awake (if the driver
supports it).

For Honeycomb and ICS, we want to be able to make a screen tap bring up
the Action Bar in fullscreen mode.  We could in principle do this by
letting EmulatorView hold an ActionBar object, but it seems more
sensible to add hooks into EmulatorView to allow an external
GestureListener, and have the activity use those to bring up the Action
Bar instead.  This also allows us to move the existing
swipe-to-change-window code into the activity, eliminating the need to
hold a TermViewFlipper in the EmulatorView.

At the moment, it's too easy to accidentally trigger a window switch
while swiping to scroll through a terminal's transcript; fix this by
triggering a window switch only when the gesture is clearly intended to
be horizontal (V_y > 2V_x).

give everyone an easier method of bringing up the software keyboard.

When introducing Honeycomb/ICS support code, we're going to want to
create new classes that can be instantiated (e.g. an ActionBarCompat
class which wraps android.app.ActionBar).  Splitting the AndroidCompat
class allows us to instantiate these classes without first creating an
AndroidCompat instance.  While we're at it, move all the compat code to
a separate package, for organizational reasons.
