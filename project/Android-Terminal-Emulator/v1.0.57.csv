It turns out that some of the open file descriptors were pointing to
resources that were used by the C runtime. So closing them broke some
C runtime methods.

Sorry to write so, but this change has a side effect: no access to Android properties from within the terminal. Test: '/system/bin/getprop' should show something, maybe compare with ConnectBot/Local. No access to properties means: the Debian-Kit app's 'Put-current-DNS-setting-to-etc-resolv.conf' daemon fails. Workaround AFICT: do not close file descriptors pointing to /dev/ashmem (props working via shared memory).

I'm willing to consider an updated version of this patch that tries to
be more selective about which descriptors to close. However, I am not
sure what to do about new descriptors that are added to the Android runtime
in future versions of Android -- how will we know whether to close them or
not?

This reverts commit 0e9b7f0cfd4aee527a79ac4c1f36c6f5f5c927b9.
