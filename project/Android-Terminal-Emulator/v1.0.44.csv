Trendy!

We hard-code the holo color rather than grabbing it from the system
resource. Might have to grab from a system resource if this color changes
in the future.

This permission was added to enable developers to use Android Terminal
Emulator to read their phone's log. Reading a log is handy when
you're trying to debug a problem while not connected to a development
computer.

Unfortunately some people were uncomfortable with the idea of granting
Android Terminal Emulator permission to read their phone's log. They
worried that the log might contain sensitive information, and that
Android Terminal Emulator might access this sensitive information and
do something bad with it.

Of course, Android Terminal Emulator does no such thing. It contains no
code to access the log at all, it just requests the read-log permission
in order to allow the pre-existing logcat command to work.

Never-the-less, I am removing the feature, because it takes too much of
my time to answer emails from worried users.

Developers who still want to use this feature will have to build their own
version of ATE without this change.
