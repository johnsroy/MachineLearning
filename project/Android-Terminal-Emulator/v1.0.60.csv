These additions allow multi-window devices to resize ATE so that it can be displayed with one other application. These windows are resizable by the user and simply touching one or the other changes the focus. The effect, with ATE as one of the applications, can be that of an IDE if the other application is a script editor. One such multi-window device is the Galaxy Note 3.

This addition adds 'Term here' to the 'Send' or 'Send to' option on many file managers,
accessable by a long press. Long-press a file or directory in a file manager and select
'Term here'; Term will open to a new window at that location.

The permission.RUN_SCRIPT permission is not used because no executables other than 'cd'
are invoked. Choosing 'Term here' performs essentially the same action as merely opening
Term, but with the addition of the specified starting directory.

I chose to use the 'send' intent option instead of a normal intent with 'data' because
I think showing 'Term here' for every file you wish to open normally is excessive, so
for the special case where you want to open a terminal at a file or directory location
the 'send' feature can be used.

It might be desired to later add a the ability to launch scripts from a file manager
by selecting the script, or other executable, and choosing 'Term', or 'Run with Term'.
This would be implemented with a normal Intent which uses 'data' to communicate the file
and would be selected after a short-press in most or all file managers.

Original patch by Frank Westlake. Improved formatting, error checking,
and shell quoting by jackpal.

Tested in 'ES File Explorer File Manager'.

Currently, when you attempt to increase the number of screen rows in a
TranscriptScreen beyond the value of mTotalRows supplied when the
TranscriptScreen was initially created, the backing store allocated in
init() will not be large enough to hold the contents of the screen.
This results in strange behavior, such as duplicate lines or lines
overwriting each other in full-screen applications.

Fix this by bumping mTotalRows as needed when resizing.

"dc881b30c0c272350092da34a14698e9082e9306","2014-05-01 00:57:24-07:00","TerminalEmulator: fix screen resizing when alternate buffer is in use

A full resize of the screen while the alternate buffer is current (e.g.
if GNU screen or another fullscreen terminal application is running)
can currently crash with the following stack trace:

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
at jackpal.androidterm.emulatorview.UnicodeTranscript.setChar(UnicodeTranscript.java:727)
at jackpal.androidterm.emulatorview.UnicodeTranscript.setChar(UnicodeTranscript.java:714)
at jackpal.androidterm.emulatorview.TranscriptScreen.set(TranscriptScreen.java:99)
at jackpal.androidterm.emulatorview.TerminalEmulator.updateSize(TerminalEmulator.java:464)
[...]

This happens because TerminalEmulator is trying to mark the position of
the cursor in the alternate buffer, but the alternate buffer was already
resized.  There's no guarantee that the current location of the cursor
is still a valid position on the resized screen, and if it isn't, the
exception above is thrown.

Even when the terminal doesn't crash, resizing the screen causes the
screen to blank briefly until the application redraws the screen, since
the contents of the alternate buffer are discarded during the resize.

To fix this, we note that when resizing the screen, we don't actually
need to care whether the main or alternate buffer is current -- we just
want to resize the current buffer (whichever one that is).  Therefore,
instead of treating the main and alternate buffers differently during
resizing, we just work with the active buffer.

In principle, we could defer the resizing of the inactive buffer until
it becomes current, but this introduces the possibility of latency at
some undetermined future time (when the buffers are swapped).  It's
probably better to do the work during the resize event itself, when the
user is more willing to tolerate a pause and there's usually an
animation to help disguise it.  (The alternate buffer has no scrollback,
so even a full resize will be relatively quick; therefore, the only case
where this could become noticeable is when the alternate buffer is
current, but the main buffer has a very long scrollback.)  We therefore
resize the inactive buffer immediately, taking some care to avoid
problems with cursor positioning (in particular, we can't trim blank
lines, because without the cursor position marking, we can't be sure
whether they're significant or not).

Linkification currently assumes that each char in the array representing
the line maps one-to-one onto a screen column.  However, this is
demonstrably false in a Unicode environment, where one screen column can
take an arbitrary number of chars (surrogate pairs and/or combining
characters) and one char can take two screen columns (East Asian wide
characters in the BMP).  As a result, links end up misplaced on lines
where these more advanced Unicode features are in use.

To fix this, we need to properly determine the screen columns the link
spans, taking into account the above; unfortunately, there appears to be
no way short of iterating over the entire line up to that point to
discover this.  To lessen the performance hit, we add support to
UnicodeTranscript and TranscriptScreen to allow EmulatorView to
determine if scanning the entire line is necessary and only scan the
line if we must.
