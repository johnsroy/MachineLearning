The request to close the IME doesn't work reliably when the confirmation
dialog is displayed on top of the activity window, so dismiss the dialog
and post the request to close the terminal window via a Handler instead.

At the moment, when we resize an EmulatorView, we're only resizing the
contents and the area on which we're drawing, not the view itself.  This
is fine in most cases (any blank space is being covered by the soft
keyboard), but on ICS, when the status bar is disabled and the action
bar is always showing, rotating from portrait to landscape with the soft
keyboard showing appears to result in an EmulatorView large enough to
push the action bar off screen.

Work around this by resizing the EmulatorView itself through adjustment
of its LayoutParams, not just the contents.

With the previous patch, EmulatorViews no longer always take up the
whole of our activity, causing the TermViewFlipper's background to show
through briefly when opening the soft keyboard.  Make it match the
EmulatorViews' background color to avoid a distracting visual flash.

During the modularization for by the multisession patches, the lazy
initialization which used to ensure that the transcript wasn't allocated
until its final size was known was lost.  This results in the transcript
always being allocated at least twice for a newly created session
(unless the final width of the window is exactly 80 columns).

To prevent this, delay allocation of the transcript in TermSession
until after the size is set with a call to updateSize().  This requires
some changes in the EmulatorView's initialization code to ensure that
the TranscriptScreen and TerminalEmulator objects aren't used before
they're allocated.

Our toggling behavior was confusing people, especially with respect
to the CTRL key on Android 3.0+ full physical keyboards.

We now never toggle when we receive the physical ctrl key. The physical
control key is only present on Android 3.0+ full keyboards.

We now leave it to the system to handle physical caps lock. Caps lock
is only present on Android 3.0+ full keyboards.

We don't toggle shift or alt on keyboards that report that
they are MODIFIER_BEHAVIOR_CHORDED. (i.e. Android 3.0+ full keyboards.)
