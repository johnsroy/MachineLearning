When running the script the bank certificates will be automatically
downloaded from each bank's server and updated.

This script requires that each certificate contains information about which
server to contact to download the certificate. This server information is
not available in a certificate, but has been manually added in each
certificate file on a separate line following the certificate's pem data. This
added line does not affect bankdroid's handling of the certificates.

All existing certificates have been refreshed using this script, except:
* cert_americanexpress2.pem (because I don't know which server it belongs to)
* cert_coop2.pem (because I don't know which server it belongs to)
* cert_marginalen2.pem (because I don't know which server it belongs to)
* cert_everydaycard.pem (because valuta.g2solutions.se:443 isn't reachable)

These certificates have been removed since they were unused:
* cert_bioklubben.pem
* cert_nordea.pem
