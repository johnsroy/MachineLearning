There are multiple different organisations, one for urban trains
(Metro Melbourne) and one regional trains (V-Line), one for trams
(Yarra Trams), and probably multiple for buses. However, they are
all under the guise of one government agency, called 'Public Transport
Victoria' (PTV). This is also where the API that provides details
of route planning comes from.

The logo is based on the one from http://ptv.vic.gov.au.
