Fragments are not kept in memory any longer. They are added to the back
stack and their views are recreated when they are selected again.

For this, all instance states are now properly saved. This should
improve memory usage and provide consistent user experience when
changing configurations such as rotation or multi-window mode.

The location input and the date/time buttons have been refactored into
compound views that keep track of their own state. The MainActivity has
been improved a lot and its drawer now keeps track of its own state.
