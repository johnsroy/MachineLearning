- Russian translation completed (but not verified, need some time, sorry)
- Some changes in code, derived from i18n
- Some untranslatable resources moved to language-independent files,
for example ChangeLog, arrays of constants of device identification
- All information about ReLaunch version and iversion FULLY consolidated
in Manifest file - now it's (forever) one and only one source for version
information! Don't implement another sources for versioning...

- small russian translation changes.
- fully reworked application and intents starting code.
Now (I believe) implementation will correctly start system applications
and applications form multi-main packages, i.e. 'Orientation Control'
for example (known bug)
- reworking may also clean situation with 'call by intent' => then don't
return to 'Home' (known bug)

I need some time for testing, so no release now.
