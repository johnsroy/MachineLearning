When this is missing, the popup size is wrong the first time it pops up. Then it fixes itself with the runtime assigned background, but that's too late.

Includes a special case for the popup builder to handle ?iI?. The 4-row mode has i as main char and I as both shift and caps char for compatibility with US QWERTY keyboards. The alternates include ?i and should be cased and uniqued appropriately.

Normally, the isShifted and isShiftCaps flags represent three states, but this key has the otherwise-unused state where isShifted is false (isSimpleUppercase is false since it considers I to be a distinct different letter and not the uppercase version of i in this locale) and isCapsShift is true. When that happens, the alternates should be upcased.

Changeset 1221 / revision bd7e81fb9856 was a bit too radical. Keep the desired behavior of not swapping punctuation with manually typed spaces in quick fixes (no autocorrect) mode, but still accept the auto dict high-priority replacement suggestions.

See issue 122, Galaxy S2 refuses to load Hebrew XML resources from res/xml-iw/. Grumble. Load an equivalent XML file from res/xml/ instead.

This probably won't fix the 5-row keyboard, but if this works it'll at least help demonstrate the root cause.
