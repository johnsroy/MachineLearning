The default 'S' altchars '???' get upcased to '?SS?', and the iteration ended
early due to using the now-wrong length of 3, resulting in the '?' character
being missing. (The 'S' characters were omitted from the popup intentionally
since 'S' is already present on the keyboard's main map.)

- add a static DeadAccentSequence normalize() method, this required moving the maps to static initializers

- use a persistent StringBuilder for efficiency, Java strings are immutable which makes concatenation expensive.

- replace the partialKey linear search with a direct Set lookup

- add 'space + combining diacritical' map to spacing diacritical equivalents

- temporarily disable most of the other DeadAccentSequence additions, I'm unsure if these are needed.

Some hackery to get the key labels looking more reasonable where the font
engine isn't handling non-spacing diacritical marks correctly.
