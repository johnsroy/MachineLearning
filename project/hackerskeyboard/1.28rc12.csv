This is a bit of an experiment, if people complain about it cluttering things I'll remove it again. See also issue 92, though that requests a QWERTY keyboard with Cyrillic alternates.

- modify Keyboard.Key to store a shiftLabel separately. It's set explicitly for the full keyboard, and automatically for the legacy 4-row ones.

- get rid of most of the upcasing logic outside of the Key class. Add a getPrimaryChar() method instead of directly referencing codes[0] in odd places.

- remove kbd_full_shift and references to it

- save the input locale in global settings for proper language-dependent case handling. Important for Turkish and its ?iI? oddness.

- fixes to candidates view handling to avoid the dreaded 'already has a parent' errors

This layout is 11 columns across, so the keys are a little bit smaller than the default with 10 columns, and significantly bigger than the full 14-column layout.

Also add a hack to disable the completions based on the 'suggestions in landscape mode' setting. TODO: this should be its own setting, defer fixing this until mode-specific config override is available.
