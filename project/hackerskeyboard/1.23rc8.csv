The sequence ACCENT + SPACE now produces the ASCII equivalent where available,
for example the combining circumflex (\u0302) will produce ^ (\u005E
circumflex), while pressing the ACCENT twice in a row produces the spacing
modifier letter, for example ? (\u02C6 modifier letter circumflex). That way,
all three variants are fairly easily available through the dead key.
