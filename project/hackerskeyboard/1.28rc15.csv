Result should be that with auto correction off, a manually typed space won't be swapped with following punctuation. Auto-inserted spaces from choosing a suggestion are still eligible for being swapped.

"dace171d0963e0a9782f52ccccc669ea414afa52","2012-01-02 15:31:44-08:00","Implement Caps Lock as an alternative to Shift Lock, new key LED handling.

The key LEDs now indicate off/active for shift/ctrl/alt, and the LED is tristate for the shift key, with a red LED indicating caps lock.

The shift state is now stored within the Keyboard class, and isShifted is a per-key method so that it can distinguish shifted from caps on a per-key basis.

LatinIME is responsible for changing the shift state by calling appropriate methods that end up being propagated into Keyboard. LatinKeyboard no longer changes semantics, it just has some tweaks for visual indicators.

GlobalKeyboardSettings can now automatically maintain state for simple boolean prefs. Other types would be easy to support as needed.

TODO: migrate some of the current silly pref handling to the new scheme.

Two places to track the same state == bad. Keep state in the Keyboard as it's supposed to be. This should fix shift-Arrow for multitouch and other cases.

Also clean up the 5-row portrait extended Fn map to add a shift key with status indicator, and prevent accidentally entering the unused SymbolsShifted mode.
