Fix removes the optimization for the forward typing case. Doesn't affect the

I think the cause for this is the Contacts database being updated. This
causes the keyboard to reload the contacts once every 30 minutes. Since it
loads it synchronously, it affects people with several thousand contacts.

Although in my tests, with 3000 contacts, the delay was only 600ms, I've
had several reports from long-time googlers about this problem, so I'm
switching to loading the contacts asynchronously in a background thread.

Also fix a potential problem with capitalizing 'i' if a contact has 'i' as
one of the names.

the change to logging to remove any private dependencies and use

I have audited this code and it appears good to go for open-source,
but would appreciate a second pair of eyes.

Still to do after submitting this CL:

* Reintroduce Amith's memory leak fix (37557) which was the only CL
added to LatinIME since the last merge over to the private copy.
* Make some changes to allow LatinIME to work without voice search
installed. Currently I believe it will show the mic but fail if
you press it. We need to base the visibility on the mic on the
availability of the service.
* Fix this code to use the new Gservices framework, it's still trying
to use the old one.

This also fixes the case where a user frequently turns the phone off/on.

3. ACTION_CANCEL event is occurred.

In the case 1, in LatinIME so far, only 'symbol key' and 'language
switch' cause keyboard layout change.  In both cases, the event is
occurred in onUpEvent(), so we do not need to worry about aborting
event.

In the case 2, long press is used only to pop-up mini-keyboard and at that

In the case 3, though I'm not sure when this case occurs, in

Fixes issue 9.

The original code had a special case for digits as the leftmost character
of the popup keyboard, and used that to decide if it wants to align the
left or right edge of the popup above the key being held.

The new logic always aligns the popup keyboard so that it extends towards
the center of the screen.

Also remove digits from popups for the qwerty row in full mode.

This change also updates the popup key mappings to match the new logic.
I had to remove a few symbols on '4' to fit, Lira/Peso/Franc are now on
the L/P/F keys.
