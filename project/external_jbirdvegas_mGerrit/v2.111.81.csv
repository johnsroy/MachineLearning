Don't make a new request to fetch the data from the cache if the diff has already loaded
and it is text.
This fixes one case where we were making unnecessary requests, but we also don't need
to make duplicate requests when the orientation changes while the diff is loading.
Another attempt to fix possible crash where the action bar is not completely removed

Check that we are processing the correct text diff
Rotating the device while the change is loading will not keep making additional
requests if the diff loads while rotating the device (shouldn't keep seeing the loading

setHeaderView cannot be called after setting the adapter in Android KK and below.,
as a result, we need to toggle the visibility of the card which will show/hide it without
actually removing it.
This also fixes the issue where the date was not displayed for the first item in the list.
