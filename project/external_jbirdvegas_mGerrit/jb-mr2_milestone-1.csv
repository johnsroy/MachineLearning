Previously swiping away a selected project would only
affect your current tab. Changing tabs would reselect
the project, a very frustrating 'feature'.

Now swiping away a selected project has the expected
result of not showing the project as selected while
navigating throughout the app.

Thanks Evan Conway from the Google PlayStore for pointing
this out!

UrlConnection transparently sends 'Accept-Encoding':'gzip' by default.
Because the underlying mechanisim has no way of knowing the unzipped
size of the stream it appeared to download more bytes than was returned
by UrlConnection#getContentLength().  On other devices UrlConnection
stripped the value from 'Content-Length' header as its inaccurate
while the stream is gzip'd returning -1 and causing the ProgressDialog
to show a generic message instead of showing the bytes as they are
downloaded.

Moved calculations off the main thread to show bt progress updates
quicker... Its still not as fast as possible but much better.

Thanks @razorloves for pointing this error out and spearheading
efforts to resolve the issue.  Razor did all the work here by
finding the docs to support his theory and providing sample
code to fix the issue. Thank you for such on point helping!

Some font size changes - making some things slightly bigger and easy to read.

Hopefully by flattening some nested layouts there will be a performance
improvement, although proper performance testing has not been done (and the
impact is expected to be negligable in comparison to better data caching).

The ViewPager still is caching tabs, and not redrawing the ones that are already
loaded. However, it cannot have all the tabs loaded at once so with enough tab
switching they will be up to date. There is (still) problems with tabs showing
the wrong data (projects not being set/unset, wrong status such as merged instead
of abandoned etc.). We want to force a redraw of the fragment's layout on
refresh instead of tearing it down and recreating it.

With the GerritURL class, we can set individual components of the query url.
This is especially when components change.

Use a FragmentStatePagerAdapter for the ViewPager and manage the tabs inside
this class. This manages the tab titles and resets (recreates) one when the
title changes.

Set the project globally from the preferences and add a listener for project changes.

Gerrit allows resumable change list queries by passing in a 'sortkey'
associated with a given change, which is now saved and retreived from
the database when making change list queries. The sortkey allows
providing the server with the change we are up to regarding a given
query.
GerritURL is parcelable so it can be stored in intents.
SyncProcessor now preserves the original GerritURL instance that was
passed in.
Make the Status (or query) the primary key and usethe replace conflict
algorithm.

Previously, DatabaseFactory.changeGerrit was not called so changing the
Gerrit instance in the preferences would not change the database. This
adds an Application-wide shared preference listener, so wherever the
sharedPreferences are modified, the lister code is guarenteed to be
called.

Added Application class (and modified manifest accordingly).
This class will help to fix loosing broadcasts.
Implemented locking mechanism in DatabaseFactory to not disturb
CRUD operations, switch the database after they are finished.

This fixes the menu option for the Gerrit instance switcher (the cloud
button).

PS5: Mildly fix changing Gerrit instances via cloud button
PS6: Fix a sort-of race condition where the activity would
refresh with old data before the application had loaded the
new database.

Now that Android supports Java 7 its time to start using the new

This commit updates Collections to use the diamond operator (<>) and
no other features.

NOTE: try with resources is only supported in API version 19 (KitKat).
Since we target 2.3+ we can not utilize this feature

Previously, after changing the theme, trying to select a change no longer worked.
This was because onPause was called after the last call to onResume.
Registering/unregistering the listeners when the activity is started/stopped instead
fixes this.
