Mostly just formatting and layout stuff, although I did move the
explanation of the Statuses out of Preferences and into a Help dialog
(seemed more fitting). I'm thinking moving the Open Source Libraries
out into an About dialog and then having the Gerrit Instance preference
in a dialog might be good as well, thus eliminating the need for the
Prefs activity.

PS3: Whitespace and tab-->space fixes ( <3 Jonathan ) + fix a compile error
in xml
PS4: Missed a few...

PS5: Wow I'm bad at this...my thoughts and prayers are with your inboxes

PS6: Color changes! Everything looks a lot more uniformed now

PS7: Pretty sure I've banished all harcoded colors to the Nether... And some
minor layout issues

PS8: Dead code can now RIP...more tabs-->spaces fixes

PS9: More tabs-->spaces that I missed

Three reasons for this move

1) App can't maintain a dependancy to ROMControl
2) We can't include Koush's UrlImageViewHelper in both ROMControl
and mGerrit.
3) Volley is being announced this week at #IO13 and this provides
a simple implementation usage example. I noticed while searching
open source examples of usage are non existant, at least
the only info I could find about it was the announcment. So
here is one example of usage specific to Images and ImageViews

If the patch set was ever public but the most recent
patch set is a draft (rare) then we see weird behavior.
This places a better failing scheme to the JSONCommit

This shouls make reading comments a bit more easy on the eyes... I tried
out dividers first, but seeing as the Comments aren't actually ListViews,
it came out looking a bit weird some of the time. I personally like the way
they look as is; looks a bit like conversation/chat bubbles... I'm always
open to suggestions though!

PS2: Do I get a prize for fixing tabs and whitespace issues before Jonathan
catches them? Inb4 'Reply: 'Done'' xD

PS3: Missed a whitespace

PS4: I am Superunicorn and whitespace is my Kryptonite..

PS5: Added Linkify for JBird :)
