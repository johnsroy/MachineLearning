This took a lot longer than it should have (read: took a couple hours)
because turns out I was hitting a probable race condition when accessing
the SubmitLinkActivity from the Browser. I'm assuming because there was
less overhead so things happened differently. The problem was (I think)
that the login dialog was being dismissed before the username and password
got read. It was a simple fix, just save the user and pass to variables,
then dismiss dialog, then start new LoginTask. Ugh. Sounds like an obvious
thing to do, in retrospect.

Seems to work pretty well. Definitely feels cleaner and more
predictable than before. Handle caching within the DownloadThreadsTask
instead of in a separate ReadCacheTask. And do not bother saving
from saveInstanceState; just save the JSON immediately when you
read it from the server.

Still needs a lot of tweaking though. When to clear cache?
1. when refreshing
2. logging in/out
3. when interacting with the site (voting, commenting)

So cache kind of gets in the way. a lot of extra one-liners will
be added to delete the cache in all the different situations...

When possible, prefer Intent.setData() instead of Intent.putExtra().

However, I also realized that sometimes the
subreddit should be passed in the Intent extras even though
it may also appear in the Intent.getData Uri; it does not always
appear in the URL. e.g., self-posts can have the path
'/comments/...' instead of '/r/SUBREDDIT/comments/...'

Tested and seems to work everywhere I tried:
* click thread -> comments
* self posts
* bestof posts
* inbox
* submit link
* pick subreddit, both from ThreadsList and from SubmitLink

Does not work on all sites, some of them have dark bg but it does not
kick in until after the flash of white bg.
At least it seems to work fine on imgur, where the dark imgur bg
will show up before the white bg behind it.

Example problematic site:
http://m.gametrailers.com

I think the difference may just be in loading speed?
Didn't see any JavaScript on gametrailers like deciding bgcolor
on the fly. bgcolor is in the <body> tag already.

even though FLAG_ACTIVITY_CLEAR_TOP is used, it still uses the
right-to-left transition by default, which is very confusing.
So, override it using Android 2.0 API Activity.overridePendingTransition
which requires Java reflection to work without crashing older devices.
Tested and works on Android 2.2 and 1.6 (which has no transitions).
Now has the left-to-right transition, similar to pressing Back button.
