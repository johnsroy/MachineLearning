Can now sort search results by relevant, new or top (default is
relevant).

Changed RedditSearchActivity so it implements the the event callbacks
directly so creating additional event handler objects is unnecessary.

Changed how data is passed back to ThreadListActivity via the intent,
now uses putExtra to store each piece of data separately.
