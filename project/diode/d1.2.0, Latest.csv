Also makes it so to 'Go to comment' goes to the comment with context.

Also added a simple UI element to display when you are viewing a single
comment's context.

A light-theme element needs to be added since the orange is kinda ugly
on the white background.

Also, when the 'Focus Parent' item is selected on a top-level comment,
it will focus the OP.

Make sure this information is stored, so that when the comments page is
reloaded, it will reload with the proper context, rather than reloading
the whole thread.

Say you reply to a comment when in the context view, the app will now
keep the context view, rather than going back to the full thread.

Also fixed an app crash when the user clicks the 'load more comments'
button quickly. (Click one element more than once, or click two very
quickly)

Also added logic to make it so the app won't attempt to load a [deleted]
user's profile.

Actually, the markdown WAS getting parsed properly, but not updated back
in the list properly.

Also, Thing contents are not parsed until the user clicks on them.
(There's no current reason to parse the comments for URLs if the user
may not ever click on them -- doing so just slowed things down,
especially in a thread with a lot of links in the comments.)

Added a common utility function in Common to display the 'Links' dialog.
(It no longer adds an onclick listener to a button argument)

Removed some unused variables from the modified files.

Now comments that are 'distinguished' (moderator or admin) take
precedence over the submitter's style. This will now also show in
threads where the submitter has been distinguished. (This required
creating a separate field for the submitter's name.)

This works in the comments view, and user's profile view. The inbox is
designed differently, so it doesn't work there. Maybe in the future?

Also changed the 'when' strings from inline-constants to be localizable
strings.

Didn't know this existed until I saw some other code using it, I prefer
this over having a separate TextView just to hold the spanned text.

Also added the 'ViewHolder' pattern to the ThreadsListActivity and
CommentsListActivity.  This will cache the items in a view, so that when
a view is recycled, the code doesn't have to find all the elements
again.

Also addressed some Android Lint findings.
