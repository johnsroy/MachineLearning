Now based on DialogFragment instead, removing the need for
BarcodeListeningListActivity and, partly, DialogAwareListActivity (RefreshDialog
still uses it, but not for long).

For the user, there is no noticeable change, but removal of
DialogAwareListActivity is somwehat needed for a Fragment based tablet UI.

This also removes the (very non-Android-ish) DialogAwareListActivity, and uses
Android's built in support for similar handling (in DialogFragment).

However, to simplify some stuff, it's (temporarily, I hope) replaced with a
RefreshContextListActivity (only to deduplicate some bits of code, that should
be possible to handle in other ways after a Fragment transition of the UI.

This API is more officially supported, and can find parcels the old one couldn't.
It requires a 'consumer ID', which due to their rules must be kept secret, so it's not included in the open source code. Requesting a consumer ID for a fork is, however, very simple (there's a link in ParcelJsonParser.java).

The new API has so far not been tested thoroughly, but the current code works without issues for my saved collection of mixed parcel ID:s. Of course, most of those parces have already been delivered...

This update will wipe the events table in the database, since the two API:s differ a lot in representation there (would result i duplicate events otherwise).
