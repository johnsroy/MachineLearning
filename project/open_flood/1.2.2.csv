This commit reworks and overhauls many aspects of Open Flood's layout

Summary of changes made:
- New star icon that is closer in size to the gear and info icons
- Star, Info and Gear icons have been made drawables
- GameActivity is laid out using weights to ensure that the game can be played
on a variety of screen sizes (Fixes #15)
- EndGameActivity takes up slightly more screen space
- 4 dimens.xml files have been created with dimensions for different screen
sizes, making the game more playable across multiple screen sizes
- The onMeasure method has been removed from FloodView, which now simply
draws the game board in the center of the view rather than changing its dimensions to perfectly
accommodate the game board
- A separate layout has been added for the text views contained in the Spinners used in
