Prevent excessive decimals from corrupting display output by limiting the
number of decimals: 3 digits for acceleration, 4 for rotation, 2 for
magnetic field, 1 for light, proximity and temperature, 0 for pressure and
humidity.

Introduce mRotation member (actual rotation, based on azimuth and screen
orientation)
Avoid allocating paths and paints at draw time but use preallocated
instances, listen for azimuth and size changes and update anything
depending on these.
