This update checkbox label in order to reflect changes.
This won't reorder the ListView content though, but hey… At least you

- Had to rename 'appName' to a pkgName in order to have more reliable
variable, setter and getter
- in order to make custom ListView work correctly, had to add new class
variables and related setters/getters.
Those new vars are mainly used in AppListAdapter
