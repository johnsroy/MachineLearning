Mike Perry reported some security and usability issues. This patch
corrects some, but there is others requirering some deeper changes.

Corrections:

- close orbot local ports so that no app can access it 'by chance'. Only
especially authorized apps may access the TransPort. Polipo (8118) is
now closed, as well as SOCKS and TransPort

- enable accounting, using a (new) dedicated chain 'accounting'. This
one just links to bw_OUTPUT in order to make Quota work again. Seeing
how it's done, it's possible we can even see which app eats bandwidth,
at least fir the outgoing data.

- we flush OUTPUT completely before doing anything. This allows some
easier configuration.

- INPUT chain is now managed in such a way nothing may enter unless it's
related to TOR traffic

There's also some cleanup in iptables rules, and, well, now, it's locked
up. For good.

This part isn't easy: try to get Orbot bandwidth usage without having
the applications in it.

Orbot uses some MB in order to query Directories, it may be good to get
them in order to have some accurate accounting.
Problem: filtering such traffic isn't easy, as ports aren't fixed 'for
good':
- some are dynamically allocated
- others may be moved in the confuguration file

Thus, this part will be hard.
This explains why the default Orbot 'transparent proxy' doesn't show up
per-app bandwidth usage, but Orbot itself.

As pointed out by Mike Perry, Polipo (as well as all other Orbot service
ports) should be closed by default.

Thus, Polipo isn't reachable anymore.
This new option allows user to enable it back. BUT it has to be used
with caution: for now, once it's opened, any other app discovering this
port may connect and thus access to Internet (through Tor). Of course,
such vamps won't be able to do DNS queries, but it doesn't protect from
malicious outputs using IP (or embeding some resolver or host file).

Next step will be to say to what port redirect the app, thus this option
should be useless. It's just a quick workaround, and you shouldn't use
it. At all.
