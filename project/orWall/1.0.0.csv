This is a small meta-type, creating a simple objet holding some package
information.
This is used especially for special apps like Media Server, as they
don't show up 'naturally' in orWall.
Code is strongly based (well, copied, sorry) on AFWall+ API library.
Thanks a lot to them for the work — hopefully we will be able to
collaborate on their new version, in order to provide some intents on
their side so that we can remove a lot of things from orWall in a not so
far future.

This just uses the new PackageInfoData object… But it works :).

This solves #50.

When we unchecked an app, it didn't take care of its real configuration,
and just removed standard, default 'redirect' version.
Thus, when we checked something special in Advanced Settings, the rules
weren't properly removed unless we reboot the device.

Now, we take care of that, and we also take the opportunity to replace
dynamically objects in 'apps' listing with latest configurations.
