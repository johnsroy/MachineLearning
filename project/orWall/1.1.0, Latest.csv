This patch changes the following:

- Log commands and the output of the command. This makes it easy to
trace using via adb using:

$ adb logcat -s 'orwall'

- Use SuperSU to change the SELinux context from u:r:sysinit:s0 to
u:r:init:s0, which allows us to execute the iptables commands during
boot.

This have only been tested on Android 5.x on an Moto-E with CM-12 and
needs testing on Android 4.x.

Fixes 69
