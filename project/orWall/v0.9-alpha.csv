- we can now set proxy ports in the orWall settings, meaning we needed
to pick them in preferences in order to apply rules

- there was a nasty bug with the init-script, most probably due to
crypted data directory; this prevented the userinit.sh script to be
launched at boot time, meaning there were some network traffic before
anyone could do anything.
The init-script is now installed in /system/etc/init.d directory.
