Now it shows up two separated lists, one for enabled application (i.e.
the one we want to make through some Proxy), and disabled.

Missing: actions.
We have to do some more dev in order to get the following capabilities:
- user touch an app, it should go to the right listing, and iptables
rules should be updated
- for enabled app, we have to add a new visual in order to let the user
access advanced features

Also, for 'home' tab, we must update display in order to use the
application settings.

Indeed, it may prevent some people to read things. More over, the 'all
dark for hackers' may prevent other people to just try the app, as
'hell, it's all black, run away'.

Thus… going to 'light' theme.

crashes because orWall is unable to get the Wifi IP address — in case
the network wasn't already up, for example.

In previous patch, a bug was fixed. This new patch allow orWall to
manage in a better way the LAN bypass (though it's still not perfect).

Next step would be: in case we don't get any IP on the Wifi, we should
ensure no deprecated rule stay in IPTables. This means we should be able
to register the LAN subnet in order to take it back.
This could be done un the sharedPreferences.
