anymore for example)

Problems:
- DNS queries are made by UID 0
- missing related,established grant for INPUT chain

Hence, we have to allow the whole system to make DNS queries, though it
has to know about UDP:5400 (qhich isn't that hardâ€¦)

This may be a flaw in the system, but we cannot do anything against that
for now.
