This won't be of any use with the coming features, and the implem was
really crappy.
Also, I wasn't convince by the use case. If people really does have so
many apps accessing the the Net, using tor won't be really useful: each
app accessing to the Net may give away your ID.

As reported in #24, the 'captive portail gracetime' for browser didn't
work as expected.
One of the causes was the iptables rules order.

The current StringSet in SharedPreferences cannot comply with the new
features we'll add to orWall.
Using SQLite will allow us to provide new features like per-app Onion
Router choice, ports and so on.

Most probably the schema will be updated shortly, it just shows the
basis. Most of the fields will not be used for now, as we need some more
time in order to modify the UI and provide new options.

SharedPreferences is kept in order to set application preferences only
(stuff in settings).
