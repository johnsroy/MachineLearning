Servald command line 'set did' is now 'keyring set did' with same output
format as 'keyring add'

All servald keyring PIN arguments are now passed as optional
--entry-pin=<pin> arguments

Encapsulate all servald command lines into ServalD class, make
ServalD.command() methods protected so that command-line details remain
local to ServalD.java

Rename Identity.sid to Identity.subscriberId
