Add RhizomeManifest_File and RhizomeManifest_MeshMS subclasses of

Look for the RHIZOME ADD MANIFEST message in the log file to indicate

AudioPlayer.cleanup() is called both from the playback thread when it is
shutting down, and from the AudioManager when it gets the CallEnded
message from servald. The playback thread will throw an NPE if it
attempts to shutdown when cleanup() has already been called. Hence, we
cause cleanup() to return immediately if playbackThread is not null, and
only set playbackThread to null immediately before the call to cleanup()
in the playback thread itself.

Rhizome *needs* sdcard. If no sdcard is present on the device, then rhizome must

A feature to disable it was already implemented, just add:
rhizome.enable=0

But it was not read by the Android application not to call rhizome functions.

This commit disable rhizome calls and avoids to make the app crash when no
sdcard is present.
