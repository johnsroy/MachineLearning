Rhizome share-file intents for files with spaces in the path name were not
being added successfully because the URI path was not being decoded, so instead
of a space, the path contained '%20', and that file of course did not exist.

Fix name 'rhizome.enabled' -> 'rhizome.enable'.  Delete incorrect name from
existing config, to stop config parsing errors caused by old config file
persisting from prior install.

Test 'rhizome.direct.peer.**' instead of 'rhizome.direct.peer.count' which is
no longer available.

The Help Subsystem of UI is changed to local webview. The idea is to
eventually have all help files written once on Wiki, then placed as
local HTML files for Android, rather than having to convert to strings
etc. NOTE: refactoring to remove unwanted strings, icons, remnants of
older software is a very good project for an undergrad.
