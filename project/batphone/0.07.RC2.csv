"e4240a6de57ff8bf162930931410add29b02c56c","2011-11-25 14:17:48+10:30","Fixed display of chipset in auto-detect if there are multiple matches.
Now says 'one of several possibilities', instead of 'Unsupported ....'.
Also fixed order of chipset testing to always try non-experimental before
experimental, so that in this case we always try the safe options before
possibly jamming the kernel with a wrong module load, for example.
This also deals with the problem of having stale invented support files
laying around on reinstall.

reminds the user to reboot their phone.
This probably comes up sometimes when it doesn't need to, because it
doesn't recheck that the wifi is in a funk.  But it will do for now.

turns off.
