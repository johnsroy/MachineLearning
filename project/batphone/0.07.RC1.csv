(guesses module arguments etc).

starts up first and does all the detection and unpacking before
handing over to the main activity (now called dashboard).

that we have everything we need, and sets the framework for then
guiding the user through testing of experimental chipset detections,
and ultimately we hope uploading working scripts.

"16eb2fa707e6e7cbd0bc4d0f0cbd08d59297df86","2011-09-25 22:38:41+09:30","Added wireless-tools to jni build.
This provides source for iwconfig, and also gets what we need
to produce a fast JNI iwconfig and also add iwconfig() command to
edify, which can be used to speed up mode switches by letting us
replace the sleep(3) with a function that waits exactly until the
wireless interface comes up.
