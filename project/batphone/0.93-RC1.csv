So that git will fetch submodules using the same transport (https:,
git:, ssh:) as they used to clone Batphone.

Now, people who fork batphone must also fork serval-dna at the same
server location, otherwise 'git submodule init' will fail.

The important piece of information here is to make forks of both repos,
batphone and serval-dna, before cloning them, so that the 'git submodule
update' command (which now uses a relative URL) will succeed.
