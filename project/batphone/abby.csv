Do not use local ./git script, it was a hack for Eclipse that was
platform-specific and worse, failed with infinite recursion if $PATH
contained the '.' directory.

Use the improved Serval DNA version_string.sh script to compute the
version string.

Produce APK files named -alpha, -beta, -release instead of naming
them all -release.

Replace 'upload' target with 'upload-alpha', 'upload-beta' and
'upload-release'.

Safety check: ensure that the configured SDK and NDK directories
actually look like an SDK and an NDK.
