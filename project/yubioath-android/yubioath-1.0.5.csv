- By disabling reader mode fully, the behavior of failing reads are
identical to before
- The main reason for reader mode is its much more stable handling of
long running transactions, OTP transactions are fairly short so can
work well with foreground dispatch
- Broadcom workarounds need to be disabled since they are only possible
in reader mode, but they also only affect long running transactions
- Document the Nordpol settings currently used
