The selection of SDK 17 was arbitrarily based on the version
available on my device at the time. As no APIs are being used
at that level, a lower SDK version can be targeted.

According to the current distribution of Android device versions,
99.9% of devices are at SDK 10+. Changing to this for the min SDK
for now.
