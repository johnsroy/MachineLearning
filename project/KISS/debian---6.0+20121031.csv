6bone is dead since a long time now.  Although there are a few IPv6-only
backbones in a world, most of them are dual-stack and nobody refers to them as
6bone.  Basically it's the IPv6 DFZ (default free zone), but that's just
confusing to the reader.

The current paragraph is factually wrong.  It talks about native IPv6 requiring
IP protocol number 41.  No, it does not require IPv4 protocol number 41, it
even has its own ethertype.  Tunneled IPv6 needs proto41 to be opened.  (And
it doesn't work behind NAT.)  Also state that IPv6 can be firewalled just like
IPv4.
