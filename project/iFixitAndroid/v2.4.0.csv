Amazon rejected our latest build of the app because they could get to links
through the web view to other app stores.  Rather than trying to fix it, we're
just going to hide the footer because that's easier and it doesn't really
matter if we have the footer in the apps webview (it's just answers)

Invalidating the menu fixes it because it disables the menu if

just in case.
