Android studio is finally out of Beta - which means upgrade time!  Included
with the 1.0 release, the android build team released gradle-android-plugin
1.0.0 (http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/migrating-to-1-0-0)
as well as a new version of the android support library (v21).

Luckily, there were only a couple renamed properties in the new version, so the
changes are minor.

Also important to note - you need to have `gradle` v2.2.1 installed in order to
build the project.

We added Magnolia Medical as a white labelled app in #239 but didn't add
the default values in `gradle.properties.base` so users can't build the
app without adding the necessary values.

`/user` call is used in SSO login to get login information we don't yet have.
All we have is the authToken which is good enough to make the request, so let's
let it go, regardless of public/private site status.
