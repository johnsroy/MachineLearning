Step media in the guide create process was a mess.  Literally nothing was DRY,
the main image and thumbnail inflation was just duplicating ThumbnailView, and
code formatting was not followed.  This is the start at fixing all this.

I didn't intend for this commit to get so crazy, but as I was working on the
ThumbnailView conversion in the step edit fragments, I kept finding things I
wanted to change.  I know, horrible practice, but I couldn't help myself.
Because of this, the commit is a mess with way to many changes to be useful,
but below is my attempt at listing everything that is happening in here.

* Project and File organization
* Packages guide_create and guide_view --> guide.create and guide.view
* Removed some unused xml files (guide_step_body something)
* Abstracted out most of the guide create step media elements to use the same
elements as the guide stpe view page.  Drastically simplified the fragment
and DRYs everything up.
* Code formatting
* Moved 'title' edit field out of the media fragment and into the step lines
fragment.
* Misc code simplification.

* Navigate to 'My Guides' through the menu drawer

* Tap 'Back'

DeadEvents were getting posted during step image capture if the user captured
an image, then immediatle started capturing another one before the upload
request returned.  If that happens and the image request comes back while we
are in capture mode, we store a reference to that deadevent and will retry it
again later once the handling activity is ready for it. This helps solve a
number of inconsistent state issues we were having with image upload.
