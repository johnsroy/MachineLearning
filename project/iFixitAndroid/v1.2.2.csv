There are still some issues on older devices (especially with the
gallery) and more views to switch over like ProgressBar.

This still needs more testing.

The login fragment was coupled to the register form which made it difficult to
make changes to the UI.  This commit splits them up into LoginFragment and
RegisterFragment.

I also switched to the default holo theme button, the other ImageButtons were
too small IMO, but it's up for discussion.

These changes add private sites to the app.  If the user selects a private
site, they are now prompted to log in.

Still need to test edge cases, but right now this *seems* to work.  Still need
to add a log out option to the action bar, as well as test registration or
disable registration on private sites (not sure what we want to do about that).
