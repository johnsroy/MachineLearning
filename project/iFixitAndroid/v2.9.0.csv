Google Login: Migrate to OAuth

Google login through OpenID has been deprecated for a little while now so
we have to migrate to Google OAuth. This results in a much better user
experience because it goes through the native interface and doesn't require
the user to enter their credentials.

This also increases the `minSdkVersion` to `9` which is android 2.3. This is
required for Google Play Services which provides the Google Login
functionality. Android 2.2 only makes up 0.65% of installs currently. It's
unfortunate to lose them but the old app will still work for them.

QA
==

- Check Google login on a few places that require it:
- Media manager
- Favorite guides
- Favoriting a guide
- etc.
- Test on various devices:
- Android 2.3
- Android 5+
- Tablet
- Phone
- Test in both orientations:
- Portrait
- Landscape
- Unexpected actions:
- Decline permissions
- Cancel dialogs
- Change orientations
- Test on various accounts:
- No associated iFixit account
- iFixit account with permissions accepted through the web signin
- iFixit account after prior sign in on Android

Closes #249
