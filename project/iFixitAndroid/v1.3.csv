No longer need layout_land.  Drastically better since the entire
layout_land/guide_step layout was a copy of layout/guide_step besides
swapping the height and width of the media and content containers.

This includes a major refactor to the GuideStepViewFragment which was
getting out of control with the introduction of new step media types.
Now it's much nicer and works a lot better.

Other changes:
* Added a loading progress dialog when videos are launched.
