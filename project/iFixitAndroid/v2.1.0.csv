The base class's onLogin method was never called in GalleryActivity
because GalleryActivity defined a method of the same signature that
overrides the base class's. That method was being called twice -- once
for the @Subscribe and once for the @Subscribe in the object listener in
BaseActivity.

Overriding BaseActivity's onLogin method and calling super fixes it.

You should _always_ call super.onSaveInstanceState. Otherwise Fragmetns

GuideStepViewFragment was broken for savedInstanceState so that had to
be fixed for it to work.
