Cache API responses for offline browsing

This adds a cache for API responses so the user can browse content offline
assuming that it was previously viewed with internet available. The
current implementation stores the JSON responses as files in the cache
directory. This was preferable to using a database because it is faster
and the storage space shows up under 'Cache' rather than 'App Data' so it
can be cleared independently from the user's stored data.

Note: This is different than offline storage of guides because the guides
and images are not stored in a permanent location.

Right now `ApiDatabase` sends out a broadcast indicating that some data has changed and `OfflineGuidesActivity` refetches everything from the DB and reparses all of the JSON. This should be more efficient because it should really only update the progress and not refetch all of the data. It should also be able to send updates to other views that display guides e.g. guides in search, topics, favorites, teardowns, etc. 0ed570d553ad2113ea457c1c592db89cdde517ac
- [x] Make sure the UI removes offline guides that have been deleted. ee46abefa1ce284141a81af911bda911d4f077a3
- [x] Make offline guides list status display look much better and display more (useful) information.
- [x] Offline guides list last sync time should update if it's a relative time e.g. it shouldn't stay '3 minutes ago' for hours. Changing it to a date might work but isn't as useful because you'd always have to convert to the current time. 771519dc927a13d1d74e5b0b5474343a46471054
- [x] Update offline guides list 'Refresh' button text. b170d20d459ad6e9be6676dddea56ccb03451df8
- [x] Change the color of the pinned icon based on the current sync status. 28cab146c8c537b263f778e873cbd1ff0f582f72
- [x] Removing favorited guide doesn't result in a UI update. 77fcbb67bf0d92ed609485d1c2f18b3bd97b96a8
- [x] Disable guide view menu items for offline guides because they won't work. f8f15b9f3b13ef367a716d873be5489dd3473cf9
- [x] Refresh offline guides when restarting activity. 1df70b53dbb92b71f6610c64f9d2defcad2057a0
- [x] ~~Delete media that is no longer referenced (this will be tricky if there are multiple users signing into a site on a single device. We don't want to delete images that might be used again if the user is logged in.)~~ Started on it but turned out to be too troublesome: 0df79be3dcb960d613b9096edd1ff060ce4fa0f5
- [x] Make sure that the app works without internet (it might be hard/impossible to view the offline guides list without internet so lets triple check that it's always possible because it would be really bad if it didn't work)
- [x] ~~`<feature creep>`Allow users to specify guide download priority.`</feature creep>`~~
- [x] Logging in causes some hanging sync stuff...
- [x] ~~Display sync errors in the offline guides list.~~
- [x] Store `GuideInfo` JSON along with the full guide and use the `GuideInfo` JSON to display the list of offline guides. This _should_ improve performance a lot. 96e0ba6d651023dcfc9bb8a8d1cc4e58bcbcdd7b
- [x] Opening OfflineGuidesActivity from the notification doesn't always work. 1430e6b1179611f83bb460bab3e04cc4cb1b4f34
- [x] Always display total progress in notification but only leave the success message if there was new content? c05d796ff7ab5f371327e4efd32650ce52095b70
- [x] Make sure the performance of the entire system is acceptable with many favorited guides.
- [x] Add more sync settings. There is a system setting for syncing automatically that the user can get to in Settings but that probably won't be found. Perhaps we should have a setting with the offline guides list to disable automatic sync so the user can do it manually instead? 016c357ff7327958807b094f1e1c151ee1980d01
- [x] Add ability to unfavorite a guide from offline guide list. (Or maybe not because you can do it once you open the guide.) c72dd586cc700f0c314bff24faf48a5df8132a1e
- [x] Don't sync when opening OfflineGuidesActivity if 'Sync automatically' is disabled. 36999d0d6cafff52f8c1ce7534f4ee27aa7cab6e
- [x] Google Analytics tracking? c958f2c657c081189518fbd7f9c61085a0ece460

Original issue: Add analytics to intent filters

It would be nice to see how many people actually open guides in the app by navigating to a guide URL.
