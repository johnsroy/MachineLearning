This completely changes how to load data from the API. Rather than
calling APIHelper's methods directly, APIService is used as an
intermediary. APIService calls through to APIHelper and sends a
broadcast with the API result to update any interested
Activities/Fragments.

This has the advantage of not leaking Activities because of dangling
references. This can also be easily expanded to download guides and
images for offline browsing.

This is very much a work in progress. The results are stored so they can
be retrieved while offline. However, there isn't a way to see what you
can view offline. Currently this is merely a layer of cache on top of
doing web api requests.

Future work includes comparing dates to ensure we are not serving stale
data, login and downloading of favorited guides for offline browsing,
updating the schema to enforce uniqueness of target + query.
