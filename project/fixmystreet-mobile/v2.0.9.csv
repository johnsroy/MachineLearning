This is a really very strange problem.  When testing the
application on an Android 2.3.5 device, there were two
problems with the <input type='text'> box on the front page:

* The left and right arrow keys wouldn't move within the
text of the box - instead they would switch the focus
highlight to another element.

* Holding down the letter key to get a number (e.g. 'w' to
get a '2') would end up with 'w2' being entered rather
than just '2'.

I couldn't reproduce this in a newly created project, so
by introducing more and more of the code from the FixMyStreet
phonegap app into that project isolated the problem to
the CSS for an unrelated element.  In short, the text input
boxes will work correctly after removing 'position: fixed'
from the mobile-info class.  That class is only ever used in:

<div class='mobile-info'>
<a href='about.html'>i</a>
</div>

Why this could possibly cause the problem above, I can't
guess.  However, removing it makes the Android application
usable again, and we are shortly going to redesign the
application in any case, so the sub-optimal position of the
'i' button is something we can live with.

This fixes #113 in that it means the user can move the screen to see
what fields are available. Previously this was prevented by setting the
adjustPan mode for the soft input mode which had fixed a bug with the
keyboard not dismissing on transition. This has been resolved by adding a
plugin for Android to control display of the soft keyboard and hiding
the keyboard before navigation in the navigate method of FMSView.

Sadly this then meant that the screen size was being measured *before*
the keyboard was dismissed with the result that the screen transitioned
too was incorrectly displayed. This was resolved by taking the screen
height on start up, storing that as a property of the FMS global object
and then using this property instead of measuring the screen size at the
time of transition.

The map has also been expanded to fill the whole screen rather than
stopping at the bottom of the navigation bar as on Android when you
scroll the screen the map does not scroll and the gap at the top was
visible.

The cordova media plugin asks for lots of permissions but
we don't actually need them all (it could be used to film
video, record audio or play files, but we don't do those
things), so they can be removed. It's slightly hacky to do
so because Cordova doesn't offer a built-in way, so instead
we add an after_prepare hook to remove them from the right
file.

This tidies up the custom theme's icons, which were overly complicated and
badly setup - almost as if we were (ab)using css intended to make extra large
icons to make retina icons instead, but we'd only got halfway. I've tidied
this up so that we use the 36px icons properly - keeping most properties the
same as the 18px ones, but scaling the background image appropriately to make
it hi-dpi. Since there seemed to be some issue with iOS not obeying the media
query on the @import statement that loaded this css, I also decided to just
bundle the rules directly into fms-jquerymobile.css

In addition, I took the opportunity to make black icons the default (instead
of white), meaning that we could remove an awful lot of css overrides in
fms.css that were swapping colors for different icons individually.
