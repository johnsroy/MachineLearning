formatJson encapsulates QDebug::noquote() calls that don't exist on Qt 5.3 but are necessary since Qt 5.4 to remove excess quotes and accompanying escape sequences from QDebug outputs.

Also introduced logging_util.h - a collection of debug print utilities. So far consists of QDebug manipulators setup and check-and-log convenience function+macro.

1. Try to use QLinkedList for the timeline in the room (but not in MessageEventModel - it needs random-access).
2. Factor out the code that searches an event insertion point in the timeline, and rewrite it using std::lower_bound to (ok, marginally, nobody will notice) speed up insertion.

1. User names are now disambiguated in the context of a specific room.
To avoid quadratic complexity, that required converting a flat list of
users in Room to a hashmap of members' displayNames to user object
pointers and changing all access to that list.
2. Room names are generated (according to the CS spec) out of
displayname, canonicalAlias, and member names (current, and then left).
Because of relying on member names, a room display name is now revised
every time the userlist of a room changes.
