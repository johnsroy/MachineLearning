Creating a bitmap with 0 width or height will cause a fatal exception.

A check was added in commit 2149745, but there are still some crashes
(e.g. issue #267). This commit replicates that check directly before the
creation of the bitmap.

Previously, genres without any songs associated with them would appear
in the Library genre list.

This commit adds a new query for genres that excludes these empty genres.

This partially fixes issue #286 (empty genres cannot be deleted) -
genres still can't be deleted, but the empty ones will no longer appear.

A gradle wrapper script allows a developer to download and use the
correct version of gradle for Vanilla without needing to install it on
their machine. Vanilla uses v1.3.0 of the Android Gradle plugin, which
requires Gradle v2.2.1.

This commit adds the gradle wrapper, generated using

```
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 2.2.1
```

This command generates a gradle-wrapper.properties that links to the
binary distribution of Gradle. For better integration with IDE's, this
commit changes the URL to '*-all.zip'

More information about the Gradle wrapper can be found in the
[Gradle User Guide - Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html)

This is a hack to work around androids stupid 48dip fast-scroll area: The framework will hijack any scroll events which happen
near (=48 dp) the fast scroll bar. We do not want this as it clashes with our expand buttons.

This class intercepts events in the problematic area and rewrites them to a fake event to pretend that the touch did not happen in the fastscroll area
