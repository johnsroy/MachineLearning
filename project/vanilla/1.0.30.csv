Android sometimes creates messed up play_orders in audio_playlists_map:

sqlite> select audio_id,play_order from audio_playlists_map where playlist_id=829 limit 4;
audio_id|play_order
474|13
479|14
480|14 <---
475|7

Such a database (created by android) confuses moveItem() - our own implementation is aware
of this bug and re-generates the play_order
