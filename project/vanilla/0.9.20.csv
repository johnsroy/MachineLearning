We are now using the equalizer feature of android which seems to be pretty buggy:
Attaching to a single audio session does not work, so we are using the global '0' id even if it is deprecated

I'm going back to mp.setVolume(). The Android Equalizer turned out to be too buggy.
The only advantage of using it would be the possibilty to go > 100%, but this feature just
doesn't work well - even on a Nexus 7 running Stock 4.2.2.
So there is no need to use the EQ if we are still limited to 100%
