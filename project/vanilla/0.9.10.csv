- Switch to next song immediately when fling is started. Makes response
faster, but can also cause a minor delay on slower devices. Setting
a lower priority on worker threads helps with this a bit.
- Simplify scrolling code. No longer uses View's scrolling code
- Remove invalidateCovers(). There is no advantage to using this since
the view has no children.
- Various minor tweaks
