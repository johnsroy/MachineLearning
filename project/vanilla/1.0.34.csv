The PlaybackService will notify GUI elements about state changes.
However: These callbacks are async and the gui may already have updated its own state, so the code checks
for 'old' RPCs. This fails on fast devices, where click -> service -> state-change -> callback takes less than 1ms

The new code relexes this and accepts messages with the same timestamp
