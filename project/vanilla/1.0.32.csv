This happens if:
* Notification is set to always
* The user empties the queue

This causes activeSongReplaced() to be called, so setCurrentSong(0); will be executed while mCurrentSong is already null.
Updating the notification in this state crashes with a null pointer.

However: The 'dangling' notification will have wrong information in this state - but it is still better than displaying an empty one as it just looks butt ugly.
We whould probably, at some point, design an 'empty notification view'

This fixes a rare crash on Samsung Galaxy S6 devices. The null arguments
appear to be caused by the GestureDetector not receiving an ACTION_DOWN
event before receiving an ACTION_MOVE event.

As we are unable to reproduce it, this commit work around the issue. It
might cause some scrolling issues in the cases that cause the issue, but
better than crashing.
