Before building native code, call javap to get the signatures of the
functions declared as native in Java code. This allows us having the
simplest possible declaration of native functions.

Unfortunately, that involves a little bit of awk magic. The first call
to awk filters out the pairs of lines for each native function
declaration. The second one transforms those lines into a C variable
declaration, of the form

char const* jni_signature_functionName =
'<the JNI signarure>';

Lint suggested this could avoid leaked objects in certain cases.

If the handler class is not static, it will have a reference to the
outer object (usually Activity), and the messages will have a reference
to a target handler. So in a rare case of message getting stalled in the
queue for a long time, GC will be unable to collect the heavy-weight
objects.

Also known as 'Dead Keys'.

Example:

In preferences set 'Default to UTF-8'.
Attach a hardware bluetooth keyboard.
Type Right-Alt-`
At this point you'll see a ` character in the cursor.
Type e
At this point you will see è appear. (If not, check that the
Default to UTF-8 preference is set correctly.)

Hat tip to the ConnectBot TermKeyListener.java source code.
