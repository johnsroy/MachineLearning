Original mch_exit() still handled stuffs that need to close a file.
So the patch to call android_exit instead of mch_exit caused some
problems. This patch provides a android_mch_exit to simulate all
necessary routines from mch_exit to complete it.

showDialog and doCommand should be invoked by different thread
(ex: vim thread and android ui thread). In most of case, the
showDialog was invoked by vim thread and trigger realShowDialog
later. If someone calls doCommand('new xxx.txt') and cause
dialog happens, dead lock happened here.
This patch move the real do_cmdline_cmd always to vim thread by
using the Fake GPM check event system.

Instead, this should copy the contents of the whole buffer, which this

zin.closeEntry(), since zin.getNextEntry() will call that anyway.
