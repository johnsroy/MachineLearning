Vim code calls exit() when it quits and that immediately drags the whole
app's process with it. Instead of calling mch_exit(), longjmp() to the
place of call to AndroidMain() and quit gracefully.

With that in place, Java side is now able to clean up before closing.

As expected, it didn't take long for setjmp/longjmp pair to cause us
problems. After a trivial change in 9694c851c76b9764 the app crashes
again on exit due to longjmp() crossing thread-boundary.

This changes the hack with a call back to Java side, which then
initiates exit of Activity.
