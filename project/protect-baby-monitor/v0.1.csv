When the MonitorActivity is started it will create a ServerSocket.
The assigned port is then advertised over mDNS for a
'ProtectBabyMonitor' service.

Eventually, when something connects to the ServerSocket audio
data will be streamed out.

Previously the monitor activity would only support one connection,
after which the activity would need to be restarted. With this change,
if a connection is established with a parent device but is eventually
disconnected the child device will begin advertising again.

Note that because the child device can only support one connection
at a time currently, after the connection is established it will
now stop advertising. When a connection is lost and advertising
starts again, it may end up advertising as another service. E.g.
ProtectBabyMonitor (2)
instead of
ProtectBabyMonitor
