The previous approach was to list buttons in a TableLayout.
However, this approach does not work well if there are more
items than can fit on the screen.

To allow scrolling of items, and also a better presentation
of said items, use a ListView.

The additional thread to feed the AudioTrack was unnecessary.
Because the AudioTrack API is blocking when data is written,
and internally it buffers data, writing the data as soon
as it is received from the network leads to better playback
performance. It is also much simpler.
