- Changelog.xml - separated changelogs in other langs. If translator
didn't translate new changelog Android should use english strings
- Trasnaltors.xml - separated names of users which translate app
- values-pl - minor bugfix and added last 'Table(s)' string

I can only do that. But i dunno how to implement using changelog.xml and
translators.xml in app.
