This commit bumps the minimum SDK requirement from 10 to 11 in order to
enable hardware acceleration by default. A preference has been added to
disable/enable the feature, however it is on by default. Devices that
are below SDK version 11 are not affected.

Summary of changes:
- Bump minimum SDK version from 10 to 11
- Added a toast prompting to restart when checking/unchecking the
hardware acceleration preference
- All preferences are now saved when the preferences activity is
destroyed
- New strings were added for the preference
