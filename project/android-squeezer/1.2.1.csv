* lint:
Mark some variables that can be private and/or final as private and/or final.
Compile the regex patterns for string splitting once, not on every split.
Remove unused 'activePlayer' variable.
Remove unnecessary test, serviceConnection is never null.
Use 'string'.equals(object) instead of object.equals('string') to avoid potential NPEs.

necessary.

The previous code could crash if the handshake had completed at least
once in the activity's lifetime.

Rather than try and track the handshake status in the activity, catch
the exception and try again in onHandshakeCompleted.
