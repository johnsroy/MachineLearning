- Check for null playerState, return null in that case.

- Note that the currentPlaylist is normally a string, so if
getCurrentPlaylist returns null it indicates a special condition.

- Use this in CurrentPlaylistActivity to affect the visibility of
menu items for managing the playlist. Make sure the options menu
is regenerated when player information changes.

- Add annotations for nullity in relevant locations.
