The previous code called ProgressDialog.show() in startVisibleConnection()

Fix this by making startVisibleConnection() only responsible for
starting the connection, remove the code that creates the connecting
dialog.

Responsibility for showing and hiding dialogs, as well as the rest of
the UI changes, moves in to the onEventMainThread(ConnectionChanged) and
onEventMainThread(HandshakeComplete) methods. This removes the need
for setConnected() and updateUIFromServiceState().

Update ConnectionState so that LOGIN_FAILED is a terminal state. Without
this, the state transition goes from LOGIN_FAILED to DISCONNECTED and
the UI tips in DisconnectedActivity do not show for this state. Adjust
the unit test accordingly.

Update DisconnectedActivity to take an @IntDef that specifies the reason
for the disconnection (instead of a boolean). Provide appropriate helpful
text for these events. Only launch HomeActivity after the handshake
has completed.

Spinners have two views, one for the spinner 'at rest' when it's
showing the selected item, and one that's used to construct the
list of items that the user can choose from. The previous code was
using the second version in both places, which caused issues with
the UI on earlier devices.

To fix this:

- Introduce SpinnerItemAdapter which overrides getDropDownView() to
call through to the itemview's getDropDownAdapterView().

- Introduce SpinnerItemView which calls methods in the Util class
to provide default implementations for itemviews that need it.

- Use SpinnerItemAdapter instead of ItemAdapter in GenreSpinner and
YearSpinner.

- Change GenreView and YearView to inherit from SpinnerItemView.

- Stop trying to use something akin to a floatinglabel layout for
the labels for spinners in AlbumFilterDialog, as it doesn't work
properly across multiple API versions. Simplify with traditional
labels, which also removes the need for fragile padding values on

This causes a problem with EventBus on pre-Lollipop devices, as it uses
Class#getDeclaredMethods() finds methods that do not exist or have
non-existent return types on earlier devices. Guarding the code with
@TargetApi or checks against Build.VERSION.SDK_INT does not solve
this problem.

This is discussed in issues on EventBus, such as
https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus/issues/149#issuecomment-76316437.

The fork of EventBus at https://github.com/yuzeh/EventBus fixes this,
per the pull request at https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus/pull/158
and https://github.com/yuzeh/EventBus/commit/dc326b0bc6966945924d616327ef0b657954562e
so for the moment pull that code in as a submodule and use it in
preference to the official EventBus code.

- Update PlayerListAdapter to retain a copy of the last known sync
groups, and compare the new sync group against the old in
setSyncGroups. If they're identical then notify, but do not rebuild
the UI. This prevents some player updates (e.g., the sleep time
changing) from appearing to be a complete change of players.

- Recalculate player subscription types in SqueezeService when a
player's state changes.

The previous code would always decode the bitmap to full size in order
to save it to the disk cache. This could cause OOMs for massive bitmaps,
even if they were never going to be displayed at that size.

Change the code so that the disk cache now saves the image bytes that
were received (i.e., the undecoded bitmap). This keeps the full size
image on disk (encoded), so it needs to be redecoded every time its
fetched from disk, but that's relatively rare.
