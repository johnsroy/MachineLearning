This drastically speeds up scanning the network for servers.  As a side
effect, we get the server's name, so we can show that to the user
instead of the IP address.

Adjust the progress bar to use the secondary value to indicate scanning
progress, and the primary value to show how many servers have been
found.

Bug 1: Shared preference listeners that are anonymous inner classes are at
risk of being garbage collected, and never being called.  Fix this by
extending the activity to implement OnSharedPreferenceChangeListener.

Bug 2: The service never did anything when the server address changed.  It
stayed connected to the old server.  Force the service to disconnect, which
will trigger a reconnection if the activity that's active when we return
from the PreferenceActivity needs to connect.
