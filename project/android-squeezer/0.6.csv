'final' has been inserted in a few places, and unnecessary
casts have been removed.

Keep com.danga.squeezer.** classes unobfuscated. There's no point
in doing it when it's an open source project, it just makes
debugging stacktraces more tedious.

Keep the Signature attribute, so that reflection works.

Strip out calls to Log.v and Log.d.

Don't rename source lines -- again, simplifies working with
stack traces.

item specifically for spinner list items.
