Calling setAdapter triggers a layout measure pass, and the measure
pass ends up calling getView(), which can call through to the service
to request the album art URL, which only works after the handshake
is complete.

Where setAdapater() calls were happening in the onCreate() or
onServiceConnected() methods, create a handshake callback and set the
adapter there.

Converting the MAC address to a long does not work for players that do

Without this, changing the contents of any other item in the layout will
cause the layout to reflow, which causes the scrolling marquee text to
reset.  Wrapping the trackname TextView in a LinearLayout means that the
TextView will not change size when then the layout is recalculated, and
the text continues to scroll.
