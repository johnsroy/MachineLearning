On (at least) devices running API 7, calling setSelected() on the TextView
displays the text in a darker colour that's difficult to read.  Marking them
as focused does not have this problem.

The trade-off is that only one TextView can have the focus, so this disables
scrolling for TextViews other than the track name.

build.gradle:
- Import the appcompat-v7 library.

res/menu/squeezer.xml:
- Use a custom XML namespace prefix for the actionbar attributes.

res/values*/styles.xml
- Remove the actionbarcompat specific styles.

src/*:
- Remove the acitonbarcompat files.
- Use the slightly different API in the official library.

Much kudos to Kurt for the original work on all of this.
