As the service is tracking players from the time it connects to the
server there is no need to re-fetch the list of players in this
activity.

Instead, use the service's current list of players, and rely on player
state change notifications to update the UI.

Refactor some method names and variables to make more sense.

- Move the player group creation code in to PlayerListActivity. This
sets the way for future work to move players between groups, which
will be managed by the activity.

- Simplify the code that determines player groups, with the additional
side effect of making it correct. The previous code had problems with
players that were synced to an un-connected master (which can happen).

initially disabled.

- Extend the service to support the commands for syncing two players
together, and completely unsyncing a player.

- Provide a dialog that allows the user to select from the available
sync groups, or break synchronisation, when selected from the context
menu.

fat-finger the list.

It was possible to get in to a situation where the service binding had
happened and the handshake had not completed. Attempts to e.g. fetch
album artwork URLs, or order information from the server in this period
would fail. This manifested as e.g. returning to SongListActivity from
another application and the album artwork and track details disappearing.

Fix by:

- Adding a HandshakeNotCompleteException to the service, thrown by methods
that require the handshake to have completed.

- Changing ItemListActivity to request pages ordered before the handshake
completes, not just before the service binding completes.

- Changing NowPlayingFragment and SongListActivity to update the UI after
the handshake completes.

Fixes https://code.google.com/p/android-squeezer/issues/detail?id=79.
