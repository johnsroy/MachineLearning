issues.  Kurt's notes from that commit:

-Fixed crash on orientation switch when dialog is showing.
By removing references to outer class SqueezerActivity

-Fixed crash on switch to portrait orientation when not connected.
The problem was that the activity life cycle methods was called
twice, because the activity was beeing recreated twice.

Apparently is is not allowed to call Dialog.show after
onSaveInstanceState, because of a possible state loss.
It is perfectly legal for Android to do that, and documented in
the API, but it wasn't handled very gracefully in the
application.

I have changed the autoconnect on service connection flow, to be
more robust.
