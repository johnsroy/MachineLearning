The player subscription type (real_time, etc) is determined by the
events that clients of mEventBus are registered for.

However, clients that register after the last call to
updateAllPlayerSubscriptionStates() are not considered.

This manifests as starting Squeezer connected to a server with a player
that is already playing a track.  Because NowPlayingFragment registers
with the service after updateAllPlayerSubscriptionStates() is called,
which means that the logic that checks for clients subscribed to the
SongTimeChanged event fails, and the player's subscription type is
not set to 'real_time'.

The result is that the progress bar in NowPlayingFragment does not
progress through the track, in both the mini player and the full screen
player modes.

Fix this by introducing a subclass of EventBus that calls through to
updateAllPlayerSubscriptionStates() every time a client registers or
unregisters on the bus.

While in this code, renamed getPlayerSubscriptionType() to
calculateSubscriptionTypeFor() to make it clearer that this method
does not simply return a static value.

- HomeActivity starts, and creates NowPlayingFragment

- NowPlayingFragment posts the Runnable to start the connection

- NowPlayingFragment determines that the state is disconnected, and
launches DisconnectedActivity.

- HomeActivity starts to shutdown.

- The Runnable runs, creates connectingDialog, and calls
mService.startConnect().

- HomeActivity finishes shutting down. An exception is logged, because
connectingDialog has been leaked.

- DisconnectedActivity starts, and creates NowPlayingFragment.

- The call to mService.startConnect() completes. DisconnectedActivity
receives the ConnectionChanged event, and launches HomeActivity

Internet radio stations can't be parsed on recent servers. According to the CLI
documentation the 'cmd' column is suppose to be the item delimiter for the
'radios' command. However the columns arive in random order, so when the cmd
column arrives, the previous record may not be complete.

To workaround this, we test that all columns for a radio has arrived before we
proceed with the next entry.

If the server disconnects before the handshake is completed, it was interpreted
as an authentification failure. If the server connects but then disconnects for
some other reason before authentication is done, Squeezer would wrongly ask for
authentication. This happens e.g. if you enter the web interface port instead
of the CLI port.

The disconnected activity (via the server address view) gives the possibility
to change all the connection parameters, and the informational tekst does not
assume that it is an authentication failure.

Update to Gradle 1.1.0.
Retrieve the 'buttons' parameter from the song info and use it to determine what buttons to show when the song is remote.  Note the only documentation on the 'buttons' parameter is 'A hash with button definitions'; it isn't clear how this can be mapped to buttons.  For now we just assume that the presence of a button hash means 'next' is supported.  This allows the user to skip the current song when using the Slacker app.
Replace enums, where practical, with @IntDef or @StringDef equivalents.
Remove unnecessary modifiers.
Mark lock object as final.

Without this, an ImageFetcher thread could be spawned, paused (because
the user scrolls) and then the activity goes away because the user
presses the 'back' button (or similar).

The thread is now running waiting for a notification that will never
come.

If this happens twice then the thread pool is filled with non-responsive
threads, and no more images can be loaded.

In addition, call setExitTasksEarly in onPause (enable it) and onResume
(disable it) so that the bitmap threads do not carry out unnecessary
work when the activity is pausing.
