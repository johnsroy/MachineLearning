This will make the build a lot cleaner in the long run.

Still TODO:
* Sign/proguard/zipalign the release APK
* Sign the debug APK (?)
* Sync POM with AndroidManifest
* Update README with new build instructions.

This was never well thought out. I'm going to give Gradle a go
next, since it's officially supported by the upcoming Android Studio.

Still stripping out ABS; going to just use native components instead.

This reverts commit 65421ae14dc6e8f6c340bbeef6b6ad1bd7317726.

Haven't tested on API 10 or others yet, as Eclipse is being stubborn.
Pretty sure the action bar stuff will crash, which I'll address after
getting this all set up with Gradle.

It builds & runs successfully.
Disabled the map view for now until I port it to Maps v2.
Also excluding the Android Studio project from this commit as
it seems to be a little out-of-sync with Gradle. This might
be fixed when I reorganize project build files.
