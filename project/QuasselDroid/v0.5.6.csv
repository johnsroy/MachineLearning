EmptyQVariantException: make this class actually extend Exception, not Throwable. Fixes a FindBugs complaint (because the class contains 'Exception' in the name).

IrcMessage: Add @Override annotations.

Buffer: make the BufferInfo member final. Enforces the implied invariant that the buffer info is initialized in the constructor and the reference is not modified again afterward. In practice this may have some (certainly not measurable) performance impact by aiding the compiler in optimization decisions, but this is mainly for code quality.

CoreConnection: Make the class final so we don't have to worry about subclasses having the read thread start before their constructor is even called (the alternative would be to introduce a new method to start the read thread and pull that out of the constructor.)

Also, replace uses of Map.keySet() that proceed to use map.get(key), because this adds another O(n*log(n)) lookup. The entrySet *gives* you the value in O(1) time, and the entrySet is actively maintained when the map is mutated, so returning it to the caller is also an O(1) operation, so why not use it?

Also, replace instances of repeated string concatenation in a loop with a StringBuilder. This cuts down on object construction costs (memory allocations), while flattening the quadratic cost of repeated string concatenation down to linear time. StringBuilder is not thread-safe, so it actually has less overhead than StringBuffer (we don't need thread safety in this context).

CustomTrustManager: Here we reduce the size of the member data associated with each CustomTrustManager object by making the NewCertificateException static. If it's not static, then each CustomTrustManager has a child NewCertificateException object, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense (the exception doesn't read any instance data from CustomTrustManager).

QuasselDbHelper: FindBugs *really* didn't like this .equals comparison between a byte array and a String; fortunately, there is a j.u.Arrays static method that is expressly designed for this type of 'deep' comparison, and you can get a byte array from a String, too.

QVariant: Convert some String-based string building to StringBuilder. Flattens complexity from an unnecessary O(n^2) down to O(n), and reduces memory allocations significantly.

QChar: We don't need to construct a new Character every time. By using Character.valueOf(), any values that are internalized by the JVM can be reused, reducing memory costs. This is purely a performance tweak.

QDateTime: Remove an unused variable, and make everything a long at compile-time, since the whole calculation gets promoted to long eventually anyway by the long returned from getUInt() (regardless of the fact that it's then casted to an int).
