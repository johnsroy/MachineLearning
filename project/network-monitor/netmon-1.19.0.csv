* Renamed the class to SpeedTestExecutionDecider.
* Renamed some methods for clarity.
* Read the last network type and signal strength from the DB.
This is probably technically slower than the previous implementation,
but the performance hit should be negligeable (this code
is called at most once every 10 seconds).  It seems easier to
read this way.

We just need one setting for the speed test interval, with the
default value set to do a speed test every time we do a basic
network monitor test.

* Only listen for signal strength when we need it
* Determine if enough network monitor tests without speed tests have
passed by reading from the db, instead of keeping an interval
count in memory.  Will be slower, but only negligeably, but the
logic is closer to the other conditions (network type, signal strength).
