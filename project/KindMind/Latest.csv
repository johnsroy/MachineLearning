want to do the updates in the background instead)

used for helping with navigation inside the app code. For example the
first tag is '[list update]' and shows places important for updating the
listfragment lists.
3. Bug fix: Moved the code for updating the list items to outside the if
statement that sees if we have checked or unchecked a checkbox. (We
always want to do this update)

class. The unclosed cursor may have been the cause of a bug reported in
google play
