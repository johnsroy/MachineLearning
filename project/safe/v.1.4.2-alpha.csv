"777e51397ec23f0bae94ff6c095402fa0c93dee1","2012-12-08 13:01:01-08:00","Moved auto locking to new AutoLockService class

Totally gutted ServiceDispatchImpl and moved all auto lock aspects to new class AutoLockService, which is now started upon successful unlocking in AskPassword.  Hopefully this will be the nail in the coffin of not having a service running after an unlock.  Plus this makes the auto lock process more straight forward.

Still need to clean up IntentHandler to no longer have a service at all.
