- convert some fields to local variables
- remove redundant code
- optimize imports
- get rid of raw List and Vector types in favor of generics
- remove unnecessary code doing nothing except sending log output from
lifecycle methods
- remove invalid layout params from ProgressBar widget, unneeded
hardcoded text attribute from TextView, replace left with start and
right with end in layout_gravity attributes

- assign BuildConfig.DEBUG to Config.DEBUG, so logging and other
debug code will be automatically excluded from release build
- move versionName and versionCode from manifest to build.gradle
- change compileSdkVersion and targetSdkVersion from 17 to 23
- change buildToolsVersion from 23.0.1 to 23.0.2

- make the task access SharedPreferences directly instead of
getting everything from the Intent
- create a separate function for turning strings with MCC/MNC codes
into boolean arrays for filtering
- add isTaskRunning() method to DownloadTaskFragment

Activity's default onSaveInstanceState() implementation will take care
of saving the ProgressBar's state. For the TextView, setting
freezesText attribute to true is sufficient to make it retain the text
with no extra work.
Also, use DownloadTaskFragment's new isTaskRunning() method instead of
maintaining the mRunning field in DownloadActivity.

The user will now be able to press the home button while in
DownloadActivity and the download will still be running in the
background. User can then return to DownloadActivity from the recent
apps menu.

Also, set both activities' launch modes to singleTask to ensure that
there's only ever one instance of either running.

- get rid of multiple anonymous listeners, make SettingsFragment
implement all necessary listeners
- remove lots of pointless null checks
- merge the preference displaying current database status with
'Generate Database' button, removing the latter
- add OpenCellID API key validation on user input
- move mcc_default string resource from values/ to values-en-rUS/ so
non-American users won't have American MCCs in the default filter
