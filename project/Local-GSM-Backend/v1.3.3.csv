The files are moved when calling Settings.with(...).

Fix issue https://github.com/n76/Local-GSM-Backend/issues/33 since the lacells database sharing between other apps is insignificant.

The READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission should not be removed before all users installed the updated version and used it at least once (opened the app or used the location service).

When the READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is removed, the permission check (and request) from the UpdateDatabaseFragment and the data moving from the settings class should be removed too.
