Removed API specific sync handlers.
Sync handlers and preferences deal in minutes and are only converted to seconds when needed.
Re-wrote how we manage auto sync to ensure we correctly show changes made via system settings. We track the sync period included disabled state, and the sync period excluding disabled state (i.e. last != 0 sync period). If all accounts are set not to sync via the sync handler, then syncing is disabled. If at least one account is set to sync, then syncing is enabled. When the user enables an account (LoginActivity), we enable syncing to match the master setting, when they disable the account, we disable syncing.
