IMO, the replaement is not as clean as the previous use of
HttpURLConnection, but it uses the exact same Http Stack than
other logins network calls. That Http Stack uses the underlying
TrustUserSSLCertsSocketFactory that allows us to save the state
of the latest SSL failure (via setLastFailureChain).
