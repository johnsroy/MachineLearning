* It's ugly at the moment :)
* Lots of bugs to still sort out with the change of the WPTitleBar to ActionBar
* You must have ActionBarSherlock downloaded and added to Eclipse as a Library project. Details: http://actionbarsherlock.com/usage.html
* Started experimenting with UI tweaks to fit in with Holo better: Square gravatars, more padding in lists with no gradient backgrounds
* Added support for the action bar icons to Posts, Comments and Reader views.

When declaring variables, as well as when defining the types passed to
or returned from a method, use more generic types when possible.  There
is no need to require that a caller to a method pass a HashMap when
really any Map implementation will do.  It is rare that a specific
implementation of a particular Collection type is *really* required.

Also avoid use of wildcard generics (e.g. Vector<?>) when the generics
type is known.  This prevents the need for casting values later on.

I suspect that many places where Vector is currently used would see
performance increases (albeit minor) by using ArrayList instead.  That
change is not part of this commit, though will be made much easier with

- move all activities into ui package, or relevant sub-package
- apply consistent naming across UI classes (mainly just adding the
'Activity' or 'Fragment' suffix to the class name as appropriate)
- organize activities in AndroidManifest.xml to mostly match package
layout.  Also use full class name (including package) for
android:name property. It's not strictly required, but the ADT seems
to prefer it.

Additional class renaming may be helpful, but I preferred to limit how
much was done in this commit.

This commit should contain no substantive changes.
