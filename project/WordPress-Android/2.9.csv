The code had no effect because it was applying to `postContentEditable` after it had already been applied to the `content` string.

Note: Galleries still saved fine for local drafts because that is handled in the WPHtml.toHtml() method.

Fixes #1437

* Made all ImageHelper methods static.
* Changed `getMaximumThumbnailWidth()` in EditPostContentFragment to accommodate for 48dp of padding on each side, instead of where it was being calculated in ImageHelper.getThumbnailForWPImageSpan(). This allows ImageHelper.getScaledBitmapAtLongestSide to also use this to resize to the proper dimensions. This ensures that all bitmaps we are adding to the editor will be the correct size.
* Removed getThumbnailWidth() method since it is no longer needed.
