* WPImageSpan appeared to be storing the exact same data as the MediaFile class. So I simply added a MediaFile instance to WPImageSpan and removed all of the places in code where the WPImageSpan data was copied over to the MediaFile.
* Changed saveMediaFile() in wpDB to also update the media file db row if it already exists.
* Fixed some naming conventions.
* Changed WPImageSpan thumbnail to be larger in the post editor. Looks nice!
* If a WPImageSpan is in the post editor, it will have an edit icon drawn in the lower-right corner to clue in the user that they can tap it to edit the image’s options.
* Removed some duplicated code related to creating image thumbnails.

* Removed the blog object from the post model, instead just use post.getBlogID to build the blog object when we need it.
* Ensure we have a valid blog object in PostUploadService before attempting to upload the post.
* use notNullStr() on getMaxImageWidth() in the blog model.

I also noticed that we were unnecessarily storing an ID to remember the spinner selection for the max image width. We can just use the Adapter’s getPosition() for that so I deprecated it.
