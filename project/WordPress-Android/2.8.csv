this thread can run after the activity onStop() and in this case,
commiting the fragment will crash the app.

Replacing a call to `commit()` by a call to `commitAllowingStateLoss()` in
this particular case, will avoid a crash but also lose the fragment state:
the selected comment or post won't be recreated.
