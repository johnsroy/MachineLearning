To remove postmeta fields via XML-RPC, we need to send a custom_fields
entry with the meta ids. When a location was removed, we would just not
send the custom_fields entry, which doesn't work.

This change sets the id for the location meta fields if they exist. If
the location is being updated, we set the value. If the location is
being removed, we don't include the value. If the location is newly
being added, we set the key and value.

We were just grabbing the lat/lng values set in the db and setting as

lat/lng to 0,0 which is a valid location.

value for the post to prevent that.

Post.isNew has a bug currently, which causes it to return
true for almost all posts (see #1463). Instead of prompting the
auto-location detection for isNew posts, so it only for posts that don't
have a location so we don't end up unnecessarily overriding things.

We will override this behavior soon to make the location setting
on-demand.

Make the geotagging for a post on-demand instead of automatically
adding location to any new post or post without a location.

When a post doesn't have a location, users have to explicitly choose to
add a location. They can use their current location, if available, or
search for a location.

The experience now more closely mirrors the updated 'add location'
experience on WordPress.com.
