You should reset your preferences for this update from the preferences screen.

Features:
+ Added a status to show if we have wakelock or not</li>

Bugfixes:
+ Tidy up for the strings, also added new time intervals for the preferences screen
+ Hopefully fixed the issue with AlarmManager holding the CPU awake, even if we don't have a wake lock acquired
