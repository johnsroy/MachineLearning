We support a superset of AOSP anyways. Furthermore, the translation here is apparently quite
poor.

R.string.disabled is an AOSP string present in Settings. It was
overriding the same string that was present in strings.xml of Superuser,
causing translations to be ineffective. Change the string in superuser
to R.string.access_disabled to avoid this conflict.

Changed the daemon to use pseudo-terminals closer to the way SSH or telnet does. Changes are extensive because the slave device was being opened by the wrong end of the connection, ie. the client is the one which should be opening the master ptmx device.

SIGWINCH is still not being handled. The next commit will attempt to address this.

Added a task to forward SIGWINCH from the client to the daemon via the
correct ioctl. Terminal window sizing now seems to work correctly.

Also added signal handler to catch signals which can cause the client to
terminate, allowing the client to restore stdin's termios. Previously,
killing the su client using (for example) SIGTERM would result in the
terminal being left in an unusable state.
