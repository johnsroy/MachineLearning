Howdy Daniel, et. al.,

I was unable to get the latest Lumicall 1.11.15 to register with my
Kamailio, and found it came back to an older problem where Lumicall was
using an IPv6 address in ViaHeader without enclosing it with [ ].  Thus,
the :'s in the IPv6 address confuse any parser when extracting the port
number...

I fixed Lumicall by checking for hostnames containing : and then
wrapping them with [ ] before sending them to ViaHeader.

I created the attached patch via:
git format-patch -k --stdout --no-signature HEAD~1

If it helps, I can also send over kamailio syslog's and adb logcat's.  :)

Subject: Wrap IPv6 addresses with [ ] for ViaHeader

Wrap IPv6 addresses with [ ] before sending to ViaHeader, but if an un-wrapped
address gets into ViaHeader, then log a stack trace.

Howdy,
What do folks link of adjusting Lumicall's default codec order, to made
A-law and µ-law the least preferred?

Here's my rationale:  (included in the attached patch)

These codecs might be the least preferred because they:

1) sample at a low rate (8 kHz) so their passband is more limited
compared to
higher sampling rate (16-32 kHz) codecs.

2) require 64 kbps data throughput (excluding packet headers) and thus are
inefficient compared to _any_ other 8 kHz codec, and many of the higher rate
codecs as well.

3) lack any mechanism to compensate for lost packets and thus produce
distracting choppy or gapped audio.
