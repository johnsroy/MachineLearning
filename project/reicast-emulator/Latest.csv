THIS IS A MESS. Sorry @angelXwind :p. We'll have to clean up and merge for r8, but most of the nasty work is there.

What works:
- full init, memalloc, mprotects, etc
- boot
- gles2

What doesn't:
- Exceptions for page faults
- Breaks texture cache
- Breaks dynarec because of fastpath
- segfaults don't work, needs special mach exc_server magic that still eludes me after 5 hours
- Dynarecs. RWX issues, and broken buffer mappings. Also some minnor linking stuff (most of it is taken care of)
- Audio. I just killed it off.
- All of the ui. Was getting in the way of me not knowing how to edit story boards...
- Input

Also, merged branch 'skmp/mac86-hackport' into skmp/ios-wip

Have fun~

This works, but is extremelly hacky. Must be started without attached debugger, lldb doesn't want to let go of EXC_BAD_ADDRESS, but reicast really depends on it getting delivered as SIGSEGV/SIGBUS. Also xcode has a really bad day upon seeing the jit code. Oh well.

There's some dynarec bug that causes color corruption on bios logo/boot triagles, TA crash on ikaruga and infinitive loop on crazy taxi. I'd guess some fp-memory-write thingy, abi, or smth. Too bad.

- Force code to compile in arm mode (arm jit -> thumb mem functions is complicated)
- SIGILL, SIGBUS. Works w/o Mach exceptions and EXC_BAD_ADDRESS
- Code buffers move to __TEXT, munmapped && memmapped to actually work
- Primitive input. Button + start, or left (works to get out of bios date screen)
- Fixup emitter for thumb2/interworking (didn't work though, reverted to arm cc)
- Block Manager: Disable mem saving / page fault alloc-on-demand logic
- Move cycle counter to r11, r9 is not clean on iOS. Remove r11 from reg alloc list
- Cache flushes for iOS
- log to log.txt
- load game.chd

This makes it possible to have multiple audio backends compiled into
reicast (e.g. ALSA & OSS on Linux). These can then selected by the user
via a config option ('backend' iin the 'audio' section). It *should*
also be possible to reduce the number of platform-specific ifdefs with this
approach.

Audio backends need to define a struct (audiobackend_t) that holds a
pointer to it's init, push and term function and also a slug and a name
as string. They then need to pass a pointer to this struct to
RegisterAudioBackend() before InitAudio() is called.

For now, I defined a function (RegisterAllAudioBackends) that get's
called exactly once (i.e. upon first call of InitAudio()), where
we can put ifdef'd RegisterAudioBackend() calls into for each backend
that reicast supports.

Please note that this commit just implements the basic audio backend
system - no backends have been ported to the new API yet. For the meantime,
reicast will run without any audio support accross all systems.

Although OSS code in core/linux-dist/main.cpp depended on the
TARGET_PANDORA flag instead of USE_OSS, the latter should work too
since it is defined in the Pandora Makefile (lines 7 & 83).

This adds the OSS audio backend, which is basically a slightly modified
version of core/oslib/alsa_audiostream.cpp from the skmp/linux-x64
branch (as of commit cdf9f3dc971506c2efd979275c2869f064e1027c).

The ALSA backend will be included during compilation if HOST_OS is OS_LINUX
and neither TARGET_NACL32 nor ANDROID are defined. This should be
changed to a USE_ALSA flag in the future (for constistency and and
simplicity reasons), but i didn't want to put too much stuff into this
commit.

This commit adds the DirectSound audio backend, which is a modified
version of core/oslib/ds_audiostream.cpp.

Porting this was a bit tricky, since ds_audiostream.cpp defined 3
extern functions that the other backends didn't have:
* bool os_IsAudioBuffered();
* bool os_IsAudioBufferedLots();
* int os_getusedSamples();

I came to the conclusion that these methods are obsolete since they are
only used core/windows/winmain.cpp in the function void os_wait_cycl(u32
cycl) - which is used nowhere. Thus, I removed os_wait_cycl and the
headers of the three functions in core/oslib/oslib.h. I also removed the
functions themselves (except for int os_getusedSamples(), which is still
used inside the directsound backend, but can safely declared static for
that purpose).

The DirectSound backend will be included during compilation if HOST_OS
is OS_WINDOWS.

This *should* add the Android audio backend. I do not have any idea how

There's probably a lot of testing required for this to work.

Since read_params, packet_cmd, read_buff, pio_buff, ata_cmd, cdda and
ByteCount have not been declared static, they are visible in other
translation units. Since their structs are anonymous, their types have
internal linkage only. Thus, accessing them in other translations units
is impossible anyway.

By declaring them static, we're giving it internal linkage so that
neither the type nor the variable are visible in other translation
units.

This adds support for separate config and data dirs.

On Linux, these will be compliant XDG Basedir Specification, i.e.
XDG_CONFIG_HOME and XDG_CONFIG_DIRS (or XDG_DATA_HOME and XDG_DATA_DIRS
respectively). On all other platforms, there currently just set to the
homedir path (so no previous behaviour has been changed).

If reicast wants to read and write a data file, it just calls
get_data_path('/samplefile.txt'). If it does not need to write to
that file, it just uses get_data_path('/samplefile.txt', false). That
way, we can also use system-wide dirs (like /usr/share/reicast on
linux), that the user usually doesn't have write access to.

The same applies for config file, where you use get_config_path(args)
respectively.

This allows for some very primitive auto-automated testing, by comparing known good frames.
As this happens on the TA level, it doesn't actually require rendering (and thus it's server friendly)

Two new config entries under the new [testing] namespace control behavior
- ta.HashLogFile, file where data should be logged, empty if not logging
- ta.HashCheckFile, past log to check against, empty if not checking

The emu will crash via verify if the logs don't match, and exit(1) if they do
