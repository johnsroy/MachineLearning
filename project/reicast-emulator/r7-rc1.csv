Integrate previously locked settings with valid user warning

Put a note about the beta compile link in the README.md

Add a super fancy about that supports Github commit logs

Revise about with git log, Highlight current build in commits

Check for a null value when getting the current commit sha

Chinese Simplified Translation from @weihan1102

Rename Simplified Chinese res folder for proper complie

Add links to the website and beta compile site from about

Add option for custom mapping to set joystick to non-dpad

Fix a missing check for the user saved value of the A button

The Moga only operates one way, there is no variation test

Add region values, Set cable to match formatting of others

Reduce the number of random string array calls, jsCompat

It was unnecessary to keep getting the array, It was even less
necessary to keep getting the preference values. The port
identification letters are set multi-lingual values.

Label the about links to prevent any confusion (Not mirrors)

Missing a check on the motion events to determine compat

Add a check to verify Kitkat, Remove the standard override

The new API verification complains about the Override, so this is a
preventative step for if and when it is updated. It may also prevent
some issues with compatibility.

Run organize imports to reduce the amount of excess code

Add a controller option to go to custom layout from selection

Prevent a leak where multiple items were highlighted in list

Add an option to open the menu with 'Menu', Select compat

Import French Submission @AndroidGX

Fix a merge issue for settings not yet available to the user

faster popup animation, hide rate me menu item on ouya

Update strings.xml

Kill the application properly, Check for Rating, Popup anim

Add a small buffer to the VMU, Fix the configuration menu

This really was a good idea if I could quit inverting the logic

Sound config options are misleading due to inverted function

It is my own fault for wanting it to make sense in GL2JNIView at the cost of not making since anywhere else

Toggle sound independently, Implement Fastforward instead

Add generic boost menu option, Fix sound menu icon state

Repurpose thread priority as boost option, Disable triggered

Account for when sound is fully disabled and cannot be set

It gets confusing when enabled is false and disabled is true

Notes:
Disc swapping should work on .gdi files (probably .chd files too).
Swapping with .cdi files is not currently supported because we currently create inaccurate TOC for them.
Only x86/Windows has a disc swap handler right now (ie: you can't swap on Android).

«At least in SpeedDevils, at title screen game do a bit weird thing
- Init TA context
- Send lists to TA
- Init the same context again
- Start Render

so, if you are clear stored poly/vertex data at 'TA_LIST_INIT' pvr2 reg write - you'll get black screen instead game title»

I forgot how much opengl sucked, so I figured I might try a port.

Nvidia doesn't draw (must be some fragment binding issue?, randomlulz returns GL_INVALID on glAttribPtr as well)
Intel doesn't compile the shader (and the error message makes no real sense. wut?)
Amd driver simply crashes (wheehaa)

All and all, doesn't look like much has changed in opengl the past 10 years, apart from even uglier initialization and more fragmented specs ~

Seems like the TA doesn't touch any of the memory structures before first write (and probably later on, but we're not gonna support corrupted ta streams for now)

According to p1pkin

«At least in SpeedDevils, at title screen game do a bit weird thing
- Init TA context
- Send lists to TA
- Init the same context again
- Start Render

so, if you are clear stored poly/vertex data at 'TA_LIST_INIT' pvr2 reg write - you'll get black screen instead game title»
