- Also moved AccountManager into passwordmaker-je-lib as I think it would be useful in other places, and its faster to unit test there
- Made build system do an auto versioning for the android display version.  Based on the git tags.

- Also improved the ActivityBar so that it doesn't need a menu for phones around the size of a nexus 4 and larger.  Probably smaller too, but if it overflow it should create a menu for the actions.
- Added some sample favorites for development is easy
- Made favorites use this autocomplete thing, that does a 'matching substring' filter
- Favorites are now swipe to delete.
