This makes the app fully exit, and removes it from the Recent Apps listing
with the goal of hiding whatever the user was currently watching, and/or
searching for.

PanicKit provides a common framework for creating 'panic button' apps that
can trigger actions in 'panic responder' apps.  In this case, the response
is to lock the app, if it has been configured to do so

On all of the devices that I've checked, there is a folder called 'Movies'
on the SD Card by default.  NewPipe should use that standard location
since it is always downloading movies :).  People can always change that
via the preferences.

Also, this makes the defaults the same when creating the dir and when
setting the destination URL.
