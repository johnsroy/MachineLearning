* still need to use the start position value stored in the PlayVideoActivity's Intent bundle, to set the VideoView using seekTo()
* need to test timestamp extraction regex, and possibly move it somewhere else
*need to find a better way to get the startPosition value to ActionBarHandler, which I thought used VideoInfo objects, but apparently doesn't
* currently there is a small setStartPosition() method

* added VideoInfo(AbstractVideoInfo) constructor, to support later implementation for reusing info scraped into VideoPreviewInfo, into VideoInfo
* Made the Extractor class behave as a per-video object;
- most method return values are video-specific, so it makes sense (to me) to have Extractor be stateful.
- The only stateless methods are getVideoUrl(), getVideoId() and loadDecryptionCode(String)
