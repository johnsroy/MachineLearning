They use HTTP/1.0, so no HTTP Chunked Transfer. Took me a fucklong
to actually find that out - almost 5 hours as I chased wrong leads,
looked for bugs in the HTTP libs, battled poor network, etc. But
was relatively easy to spot once I started logging HTTP requests.

Now, if only Java had a decent documentation browser...

Now we send out a request before every upload to check if
the user is logged in. If not, we re-login.

Need to study this more - this adds a little bit of extra latency
to every upload. But if the upload fails because of a login failure,
it will mean we'll have to re-upload the entire thing. Choices.

Also added a debug method to convert XML object to a String. Was
amazed at the power of Java being able to make such a complex task
accomplishable by a single line </s>
