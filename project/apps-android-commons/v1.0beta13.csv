Loads and displays default or English description, and categories.
No caching of this info yet.

Scrollable pane is a ListView, with the title/desc/category label
in a 'header' view along with a spacer view. The height of the spacer
is set dynamically to the height of the total fragment minus 48dp,
giving room for an initially-visible title section and a little
spillover so you can see it's scrollable.

Clicking on a category in the cats list opens the category page in
an external web browser. In the future this should open the category
within the app, but we don't have a per-cat view yet.

Description and category list are not yet editable.

We were crashing when rotating in the detail view, because the detail
view fragment had assumed that its parent activity had already loaded
up its cursor and such before it got created -- an assumption which
fails dramatically when rotating, or switching away and back after
we got paged out of memory.

Check whether we got an object, and if not ask the parent to ping us
when it's done loading.

Also tweaked one of the older delay hacks to avoid a second crash
related to the pager's adapter.
