Saves original file into the SD card 'Downloads' directory via

On Gingerbread the notification vanishes after downloda, but we
force the gallery to reindex the downloads area so you can still
manually bump over to Gallery.

On ICS/JB the notification hangs around and can be used to open
the saved file directly.

Note that on Gingerbread we have to download over HTTP because
DownloadManager didn't support HTTPS.

Add support for using Volley to load remote images instead of UIL

1. Gives us Caching
2. Load images at full resolution, rather than hardcode them. This is done by trying to fetch an image at highest width possible for the particular view. If it 500s, we assume that the image is smaller than the requested width and just request the full size image
3. Created a MediaWikiImageView, to which you can pass a Media object and it will display it. Takes care of sizing, etc. Optionally you can also specify a view to use as the 'loading' view.

TODO:
Loading from content:// URIs still use UIL. Need to write a Volley HTTP Stack that can fake responses for content:// URIs.

We were crashing when trying to take a photo if no camera was
present on the device, since no activity can be found for the
camera intent and an exception is thrown.

Work around this by simply checking if the device has a camera
via the package manager feature checks, and hiding the menu item
if relevant.

People can pick from CC BY-SA, CC BY, or CC0. The commons templates
are set using {[self}}, which I think is good enough.

Initial port of the acceptable use tutorial from iOS app. This version uses static images and is not yet animated. Indicator circles on the pager are done using Apache-licensed https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator -- imported via maven. Currently the tutorial launches when we reach the login screen (as when first installing the app or creating a new account from system settings). You can either 'back' out of it or page through and hit the 'yes' button.
