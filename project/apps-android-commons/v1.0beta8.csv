Strangely, the \}\} regex seems to match the | character. Weird,
confusing and scary. This *might* be an ICU Regex vs Java native
Regex thing, or it might be something more subtle / obvious that
I am missing.

However since we're simply doing character matches, doing a simple
equals should suffice for this.

Goddamn wikitext.
