as part of the munge code cleanups, a safety check was added to the munge searches. if no munge sets can be found, an exception is thrown and no requests are sent. if these requests are posted as part of the regular IITC boot process, these exceptions cause IITC to fail to load. this is a quick and safe fix

For RLA, the first multiplier is 2x. Subsequent RLAs add 0.5, 0.25, 0.25 to the multiplier. But expressed as a fraction of the initial multiplier, this is 0.25, 0.125, 0.125. Scale array has been updated to reflect this. This means the '-1' in the calculation is no longer required, and that boost is correctly calculated when baseMultiplier is anything other than 2 (eg VRLA, when it is 7).
If there aren't any Link Amps, the multiplier is 1x.
