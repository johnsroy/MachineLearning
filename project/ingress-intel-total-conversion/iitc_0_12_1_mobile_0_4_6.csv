* Pass the entire acquired item into resource decoders instead of the attribute in question. Generic 'resource' objects have things we need to examine.
* Formatted support for the `resource' taxonomy (portal keys and JARVIS/ADA). Remove standard 'default' taxonomy in favor of this.
* Let individual items override their own primary key (for example, JARVIS/ADA are both a FLIP_CARD, but we don't want to smash them together)
* Let the server-side item name override the 'hard-coded' name in IITC
* Assuming that passcodes can eventually work like portal hacks, add support for the MEDIA and PORTAL_LINK_KEY item types.
* Change plaintext and HTML display for modResources in anticipation of link amplifiers
* Log entire JSON response to the console if we have to guess about items.
* Add more encouragement.
* Add Jarvis/ADA JSON responses, fake media items, and fake portal keys to json_examples.
