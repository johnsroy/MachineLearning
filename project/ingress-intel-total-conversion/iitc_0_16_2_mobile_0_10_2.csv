* in theory, this is not needed anymore since iitcm now has its own

* plugin and cache them on sdCard. This would make use of the webviews
* cache...to stay consistent with our external storage preference we
* need this method.

the user may want to use different zooms in follow mode (for example
if he rides a bike or drives a car)...unfortunately, leaflet triggers
maps movestart event _before_ the zoomstart event. this makes it
impossible to differentiate between a mapmove triggered by a zoom-event
or a move-event. the user can leave the follow mode by pressing the
getLocation button...this should be enough.
