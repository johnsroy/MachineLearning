If you want maximum screen estate you can disable them until you clear your
cache:

Firefox: CTRL+SHIFT+K
Opera/Chrome: CTRL+SHIFT+I, select console

Then enter the following and hit enter:

localStorage['iitc.zoom.buttons'] = 'false'

You can enable them by exchanging “false” with anything else or by clearing
your cache. You can close the web developer console by hitting the shortcut
again or clicking the x-button somewhere.

– fix #103 by always re-rendering resonator details.
A follow-up patch could also avoid re-rendering resos if they did not
change. Given that there are only a few on these high zoom levels, perf
improvement might be negligible though.
- fix #91. This avoids drawing portals/links/fields again if they are
hidden. The patch looks for those hidden entities and either removes
them before re-drawing (portals) or skips re-drawing altogether:
- Fields and Links are assumed to never change as long as their GUID is
the same. This avoids deleting and re-creating links/fields all the
time and might improve speed. Haven’t tested though.

At a glance high level indicator of portals in disrepair. Opacity is
used to denote how much it's hurting. (Bright means needs the most
attention.) Factors in current energy, missing shields, or missing
resonators. Red means it needs attention. Orange means the same thing,
except that it's down at least one resonator.

I realise this is in opposition to game convention where dim == almost
dead, but I tried it that way, and it just made no sense to me to do it
that way. The whole point is a high level way to quickly identify
portals that most need repairing. If opacity isn't done this way your
eyes are most drawn to the portals that least need your attention.

The old system was getting too complicated to add new features to.
The new one should be easier to understand and will be explained
below. This patch should fix #140 and fix #16.

There are several places where new data requests may come from:
- chat.needMoreMessages checks if we are scrolled too far up or
there is no scrollbar. It then requests new messages.
- scrolling up
- switching the chat tab via chat.chooser
- auto refresh
- once on boot
The latter two always request both types of chat.

Faction and public are handled the same way. Public is later split
into categories. I will explain the faction chat here because it’s
easier.

It starts in chat.requestFaction. This will initialize the query to
the server for data. The exact query is determined by chat.
genPostData. There can only be one faction chat request at a time.
Clearing on map move is handled automatically in code/requests.js.

Let’s assume the data query is successful. It is now passed to
chat.handleFaction which runs some basic checks before the data is
processed and stored in chat._factionData. This is done by chat.
writeDataToHash. The hash keys are the message GUIDs to avoid
duplicates. The hash values are an array of timestamp, processed
message and other meta data.

There is only one way to render faction chat, so data is directly
handed to chat.renderFaction which immediately hands it to chat
.renderData. renderData discards the GUIDs and sorts the values
by their timestamp. It then iterates over the data to insert
date break lines and finally renders the data in the DOM. It also
does some magic to keep the correct scrolling position.

Chat data will be cleared on map move or zoom. However, the
display is not refreshed, so the old, invalid chat data is still
displayed. Only once the data query is finished the data is
rendered. The upside is that small map operations within your
local area appear to never lose their chat data. Downside is that
there’s invalid chat for some time when changing cities.

Improvements welcome. Tooltips are currently placed at the bottom of the

it not anywhere where one would expect a tooltip. I immediately regret
having chosen jQueryUI. It’s not very flexible and has awkward defaults.

If I understood everything correctly, the reason was that the for-loop
doesn’t create a separate context, thus the reference to r was made for
the whole renderResonator function. This obviously references the latest
r after the loop has finished. Switching this to $.each where each
iteration is a new anonymous function and thus a closure, r is referenced
correctly.

Please reopen if this does not fix the problem.

* Don't show AP or XM if the passcode didn't give any.

* Display random words of encouragement for successfully redeemed passcodes
* Refactor redeeming into smaller functions, using more jQuery logic
* Add redeem 'handlers' - combinations of 'decoders' and 'formatters' for each taxonomy of item
* Add heuristic item guessing. If IITC can't figure out directly what an item is, try to guess what taxonomy of item it would be closest to. (For instance, if an item is truly unknown, but has a 'rarity' attribute, it's going to be close to a modResource. Likewise, if an unknown item has a 'level' attribute, it's going to be close to a resourceWithLevels.
** Tailor formatting and decoding based upon that guess. Worst case: the item is truly a mystery. Don't discard it: display it in a default format.
** Let the user know if we tried to heuristically guess an item. This won't happen unless something changes on the Ingress backend.
