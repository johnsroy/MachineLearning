iitc detects the correct map params anyway, but warns when fallback values are different
also, new data in portal entities - unknown12 (only seen 'null') and index 13 (portal timestamp)
the timestamp is also in the portal details, so this will be handy

maybe Niantic should have load-tested the best values in dev before releasing into production, rather than repeatedly changing it so many times?
or at least made it completely controlled by server-side code, so no client updates needed for every experimental change...

also, better warning when failing to extract tile parameters from stock - as if this fails it's probably because the values have changed and IITC will break

increase the number of items rendered in the render queue batches - should make IITC render a bit faster, especially now that the portals have gone and instead there's a fair amount of duplicate data from links/fields across multiple data tiles
