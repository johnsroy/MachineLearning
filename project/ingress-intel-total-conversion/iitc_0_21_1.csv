now the backend servers are culling the data more aggressively than before, it's probably more efficient to rely on that than try and impose our own additional reduction in detail level

seems OK, so remove the user prompt - it will break badly if declined. logging remains, to help diagnose issues
also fix silly typo that prevented it from actually working right :)

low values (<=100) are displayed as-is, for existing portals. it's unknown how the backend servers actually handle a mix of old and new mods
