note: currently doesn't always work correctly (size changes, but not colours?!) - hopefully pending map data rewrite will sort that out

1. Failed to create more than one realtime document.
Pass assignIdCallback and failedCallback as function parameter for FileSearcher instead of saving it.

2. If a client with empty data use Sync plugin first, other clients will lose their data once connected with Realtime API.
Assign '' to lastUpdateUUID on model initialization if the client do not have data.

3. Realtime API sometimes return 'CLIENT_ERROR' instead of 'NOT_FOUND' if a file is not found
Change handling of 'CLIENT_ERROR' to the same as 'NOT_FOUND'

- don't assume jquery is available when initially processing JS - setupIdle function added
- don't detect portals from a 'turret' entry - use 'portalV2' as the stock site does
