updated to take account of the new map data tile sizes
- show-more-portals no longer causes unfriendly request tile sizes. unclaimed are now visible one level further out, but l1+ is no longer available one level further in (i.e. it jumps directly from l2+ to all portals)
- slow-less-portals-when-zoomed-out - major reductions in portal visibility levels - works around the daft tile size/zoom level combinations used in the current stock intel site

Calculates the link range for portals with <8 resonators as well, but uses a dashed circle and a striked-through range value for those.

The tooltip over the range value in the details pane shows base range, link amp boost and total range.

The range for portals with missing resonators can be important because links with shorter lengths might originate here. Those will collapse when the total link range drops below their length, but not as soon as a resonator is destroyed.
