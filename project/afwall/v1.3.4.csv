~ separated ToDo and already done (updated already done)
~ changed Compile AFWall+ text, some spelling corrections and the fellas should always use a recent software build (e.g. latest javac is 1.9 unstable) so I changed it to 1.8 stable
- we should always mention that newer api's and versions are 99% backwards compatible ... so no need to hang on outdated stuff
