Running ndk-build from the app directory will build nflog.  Tested with
NDK r9.

This prevents stale nflog processes from hanging around when AFWall
terminates.

By default, printf() and similar functions will perform buffered output,
delaying AFWall's receipt of the log entry.  To avoid this, just invoke
fflush() from the callback.

Under some circumstances the service may start up on its own, before
applySavedIptablesRules() is able to set up the path.  The result looks
like:

I/AFWall  ( 2983): nflog shell started
D/AFWall  ( 3065): Starting null

Of course, if we try to run 'null' instead of the nflog utility, then no
logs will be generated.
