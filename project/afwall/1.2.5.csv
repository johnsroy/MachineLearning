Use the ConnectivityChangeReceiver for more than just roaming: any time
the system notifies us that the network configuration has changed, see if
any of the parameters relevant to AFWall+ have changed.  If so,
recalculate and reapply the firewall rules.

This should also address ukanth/afwall#134 (OUTPUT rules left wide open
after tethering is disabled).

Applying new rules directly from ConnectivityChangeReceiver (as was done
for roam change events in the past) may have been a cause of UI
responsiveness problems.  This commit represents the first steps toward
centralizing the apply*IptablesRules operations in
BackgroundIntentService, which will serialize the requests.
