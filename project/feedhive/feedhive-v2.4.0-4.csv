If downloading speed is very very slow, user should wait quite long time
until finishing one-read-operation (until download buffer is filled)
becase of 'synchonzied' lock.
This may takes longer than expected depending on network state.
So, in spite of risk of stability, 'lock' for downloading file is removed,
and just 'boolean flag' is used for it.
I'm not sure about stability due to race-condition but it seems ok for me.
I need to keep eyes on stablity in this case...

DB lock was used for fast-interrupt,  safe DB, avoiding race-condition etc.
There are two properties (I believe it's true) used instead of DB lock.
- one SQLite operation is thread-safe and atomic
- Java thread doesn't stop forcely even if it is interrupted by calling 'interrupt()'.
Java thread always can be stopped by explicity code.
By using those property, I removed all DB lock.
Most benefit is Performance.

Even if it's very rare, whole item type of channel may be changed later.
Or in case of some channels, there may be NO items at first and then item is added later.
I'm not sure that this - updating action at every channel update - is better than before or not, and it doens't have any side-effect or not... but let's try.

Running scheduled update during export/import DB file, may corrupt DB, because accessing DB file in OS and SQLite are in race-condition.
To avoid this, scheduled update SHOULD NOT run during export/import DB file.
And also, export/import DB file SHOULD NOT run during scheduled update is running or channel update is running in background.
Implementation is still premature and well-designed at this moment.
Continuous re-factoring and debugging is stronly required because DB is most important asset of this Application.

Issues
------
Too many changed in one commit.
Why?
Trying to coding -> Some improvement points are found -> Improving those before
forgetting about those -> continuing coding -> ... repeatedly...
I think this is big disadvantage point of one-man-project... T.T

Big refactoring
---------------
Several classes and variable names are changed.
- Name like 'OnEvent' is not used anymore.
- Name 'Listener', 'Worker' and so on is used
- DBPolicy and RTTask have more listeners to notify it's internal events.
(This is to support notification manager.)

Feature Implementation
----------------------
Notifications for 'update', 'download' and 'new feed' are implemented.
(NotiManager is newly introduced to support this feature.)

Here is copy of comments
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sometimes released version may have some issues regarding scheduled update.
Once scheduled update is executed for some reasons, next scheduled update is
not set either.
That leads to scheduled update never happens until there are some changes at
channel (adding new one or deleting existing one) even if issues are already
fixed.
To avoid this case, reschedule whenever starting application.
This may lead to some delay for starting application(but not much) and no
harmful.

Cause: There were no connection between app widgets and App.
Usually, scheduled update is run when App is killed.
So, even if update is run, there is no connection to app widget.
Therefore, app widgets doens't update.
Solution: Whenever App. is started, make connection between App. widgets and ViewsFactories to listen DB state.
