Use improved iptables rules to ignore logging for blocked apps.

Instead of logging all apps and having to parse each and every log message
to determine if a message belongs to a blocked app, we can now simply add
an iptables rule to not provide any log messages for blocked apps!

This means we no longer have to waste precious CPU/battery resources parsing
messages that we don't care about.
