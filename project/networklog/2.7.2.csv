- use binary search when looking for app to update
- renamed 'Unspecified' entry to 'Kernel'
- add linux and root icons
- app sort menu now sets checked on current sort method
- minor refactor of sort code
- improved logcat logging statements
- added missing project/ant properties files
- replaced log view automatic scrolling with TRANSCRIPT_MODE_NORMAL

- use fast scroll thumb to allow quicker scrolling through large lists
- limit log entries in log view to last 15,000 entries
- log and apps are both filterable by hardware keyboard (filter menu item coming soon for those lacking a hardware keyboard)

History loads at least 40% faster (depending on IO speeds)
Don't create uid string and name lower-casing until needed
Get uid string directly from StringPool when possible to avoid valueOf() calls
Cache lowercased names in StringPool to avoid toLowerCase() calls
Replace instances of toLowerCase() in tight loops with StringPool.getLowerCase()
Replace pool.size() with StringPool.size field
StringPool now checks pool size only on additions
Setting max log entries now takes effect immediately
Cache max log entries value in Settings instead of always retrieving from prefs
