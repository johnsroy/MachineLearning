There is a race-condition when posting to a handler belonging to a different
thread in which the logic in the handler might not have finished executing
by the time we attempt to access data initialized in it.

To correct this issue, we use a FutureTask to ensure the logic in the Runnable
has finished executing before continuing on.

FileSelector is a library designed to facilitate the ability to browse
the Android filesystem and select a filepath to open or save files.

The code is taken from:

http://developer.samsung.com/android/technical-docs/Implementing-a-file-selector-dialog

and modified into a library project.  The modifications include, but are not
limited to, adding `fs_` prefixes to all resource ids and various bugfixes.

This code was chosen because it did not have a restrictive license at the time
of copying (2013-09-26), and it has numerous nifty features such as the ability
to create new folders when saving and the ability to set a file filter.
