- Use command.waitForExit() instead of command.checkForExit() to get exit value.

By using checkForExit() the command may or may not have exited yet, and could
incorrectly return the default exit value of -1.  Using waitForExit() makes
sure the command exits and returns the correct exit value.  This fixes the
iptables command issues (check-rules error, etc).

- Check command.exitval in addition to command.error in checkRoot()

Previously, we only checked to see if there was an error rather than ensuring
that the correct exit value was returned.  Now we check both cases.  This
fixes the issue where sometimes a device would incorrectly be detected as
rooted.

- Add error as member of ShellCommand instead of returning a String
from cmd.start()

It's just cleaner this way.

The Opacity preference for Connection Notifications was not dependent

On GINGERBREAD, creating a new Toast object causes them to queue up and
continue to display long after the user stopped moving the postion/opacity
sliders.  Meanwhile, on JELLYBEAN it is necessary to create a new Toast object
otherwise the Toast.cancel() permanently kills the current Toast object.  To
fix this, we now test against SDK_INT to determine whether to create a new
Toast object.

We also now inflate the toastLayout every time otherwise 4.3 crashes.

Note: The sample toasts still do not display properly in HONEYCOMB and ICS.
