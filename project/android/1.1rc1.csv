"d01be92084bb0c2cb19d0691dc598a30054e4161","2010-10-06 09:55:05-04:00","Revise application startup flow so that dictionary discovery is not
run automatically (see issue 1).

Now the application will simply open previously opened
dictionaries. If none were open user will be presented with
Dictionaries activity to initiate SD card scan to find dictionaries
before proceeding to Lookup activity.

This should also fix intermittent search box breakage (see issue 2)
which appears to have been the result of looking for/loading
dictionaries progress dialogs popping up and stealing focus from the
search box at a bad moment.
