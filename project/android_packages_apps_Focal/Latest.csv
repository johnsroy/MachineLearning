I'm still not sure what to do with that, either we
use AOSP behavior and scroll the right to the gallery and
use the review drawer simply to quickly review burst shots for
instance, or we fully use the review drawer for all the shots.
It needs a lot of refinement on all sides, but I need a playground
to test how I could make a proper use of that.

I also prepared it for a 'Quick Review', like for examples
stacking shots from burst shot in a smaller version of the
review drawer, so user can see them directly and eventually tap
them right after being done with the burst.

There's some good ideas behind that, but I'll need some
experiment first.

GPUs that don't support non-Power-of-Two textures needs
to scale the image to the nearest power-of-two size, otherwise
GL is unhappy. It happens on Oppo Find 5 and Xperia Z (Vanilla
Adreno blobs).
However, non-PoT textures works fine on tegra3, exynos4
and nexus 4, so I'll leave the non-PoT support enabled for now.

When using PoT texture, big pictures have to be scaled down,
which can result in a little quality loss. However, since 13MP
pictures are just a little above 4096, it's almost imperceptible.
It takes a lot of ram however, hence why largeHeap has been
enabled (to avoid OutOfMemory error on Bitmap operations).

Quoting my comment from ShutterSpeedWidget.java:

* What is done here (0-12, auto) is sony-specific anyway, so it
makes sense to keep it this way

Users of devices w/o cameras complain of the 'useless' Focal in the launcher.

By copying the DisableCameraReceiver from Gallery2 into Focal, it now does a one-time check for cameras on the device (nearly the
same behaviour as the camera portion of Gallery2 -- see below). If none are found, all Focal activites are disabled (hiding the icon
in the launcher).

Slight difference in the disable check compared to the Gallery2 camera check: Focal's check only hides the icon if there are NO
cameras found, where the Gallery2 camera icon will be hidden if there are no REAR cameras found.

This patch:
- Update prebuilt assets - these are going to disappear soon. See the
second patch for details on the JNI part changes
- Add a libpopen_helper to let us run binaries through popen instead
of Java runtime class (which used to freeze randomly for no reason)
- Make use of pto_gen/cpfind in place of autopano, which is much better
and open up future enhancement possibilities (most noticeably, pre-
alignment of images so that it doesn't spend multiple minutes trying
to match each image separately, when we already know the relative
position of each shot).
- Make use of multiblend instead of enblend, which works similarly but
much faster (like, 172x faster)

PS2:
- Pre-align images using the gyroscope orientation to match only images
that are next to each other.
- Reformat shell command calls to be cleaner (using String.format)
- Use constants for settings

PS3:
- Cancel the addition of linefind
- Remove autopano
- Raise PicSphere default quality
- Don't lock 2:1 canvas on PicSphere render
- Support multiple PicSphere being rendered at once
- Fix percentage progress with new steps
- Use multiblend --wideblend option
- Various stability and bugfixes

This commit revamps the way the side bar
and widgets UI works. While keeping it
mostly similar to how it used to work, it has
been changed to better fit quick gestures.

The sidebar now have bigger icons and a short
text description beneath each item (Note to
translators: Some text might be too big, there
is a limit of 2 lines to keep it clean).
The widget panel also uses bigger icons and are
scrollable, with the description of each icon
scrolling in marquee. A widget can be dismissed
by swiping its 'title bar' to the right.
Widgets can also now be pinned to the main screen,
so that they are immediately accessible without
having to open the sidebar. Their toggle icon
then appears on the main screen instead of the
SideBar.

This also fixes the cling not showcasing the
views at the right place, and maybe one or two
other bugs.

This is still a work-in-progress and a few bugs
are to be expected (especially in landscape, I've
mostly tested it in portrait).

cpfind uses ./ instead of the actual image path.
It causes a few troubles on devices not using multiuser,

This is highly ugly, but it's 2am and I just want this
fixed :)
