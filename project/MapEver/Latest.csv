I am not completely sure how this differs from
getAbsoluteFilePath('') but that one results in
an error that the path does not exist for me when
running in the emulator.
It also seems more like the way it is supposed to be done.

Switching to datadir, and only for .track files was a stupid idea
by me...
The 'directory not found' issue I had seems to have been a temporary
glitch.
But even if it wasn't, the getAbsoluteFilePath implementation could
be changed to use it.
For e.g. backup and also due to the potentially small size of the
app partition, using the sdcard location that getAbsoluteFilePath
uses is probably indeed the better choice.
The standard 'data dir' might be better for privacy reason though
(and would allow different app variants to have different data),
so making it an option at some point might make sense.
That should still be done via changing getAbsoluteFilePath so that
all data files end up in the same place.
