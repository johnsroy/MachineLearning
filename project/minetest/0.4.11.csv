See: https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/1525

Background
Wuzzy2: If you attempt to spawn a L-system tree with minetest.spawn_tree, you can make Minetest crash if it is attempted to pop an empty stack.

ShadowNinja: This shouldn't cause a segmentation fault, but it should throw a Lua error

Commit Description
This commit throws a Lua error instead of causing a segmentation fault. The server will still 'crash' but will include a Lua backtrace.

L-Systems fix randomness
Unless a random seed is provided (via Lua treedef) seed the PRNG with a different seed for each tree
Resolves: https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/1469

So I was checking out minetest and wondered how many developers there are
and how they development community is setup and such, so I decided to have
a look at the git shortlog. There were lot of double entries for some
persons, so it was harder to estimate the number of people involved.

By adding a .mailmap file, the overview of the authors is much improved

* use two CPUs
* make seems to fail if $(nproc) is used unlike WeeChat. ZNC has
same issue.
* mark build as failed if one job fails immediately without waiting for
all builds to finish.
* this doesn't stop jobs that didn't finish before build was marked
failed.

Revert 'Remove m_ext_ptr in GUIFormSpecMenu, replaced by refcount mechanism'

This reverts commit b49e5cfc7013cef7e9af79d17e04f7e7e4c377d4.

Basic reformatting with astyle
-- additional formatting will be modified, manually, as the need for it is encountered

Start 'outlining' what a MinetestApp class might look like

Add MinetestApp::shutdown()

Converted class member functions to camelCase and created protos for new functions

First stage of connect to server done

Add get itemdefs/nodedefs/media code

Init clouds, camera, sky, init GUI, HUD

Input handling

Client events, camera, sound, draw

Fix wield hand getting stuck digging and add debug text back

Fix FPS

Added profiler graph back

Fix FPS issue
Need to work out what went wrong and clean up the copy/paste stuff

Annotate

Various:
Rewrote limitFps()
Limited scope of some variables

Jitter calcs

Reduce scope of objects

Move some stuff out of ::run and minor formatting cleanup

Scope reduction

Function splits

Removed old (broken) limitFps()

Added exception handling back

Fixed some formatting

Reverted commented out unit tests (uncommented them)

Slow clouds down on loading and media screens so the behaviour is like the original the_game()

Formatting/style (no functional changes)

Manually reapply upstream b49e5cf: Remove m_ext_ptr in GUIFormSpecMenu, replaced by refcount mechanism

Fixed silly errors on my part
Minor formatting cleanups

Removed strange differentiation in FPS limiting when loading
FPS limiting was done differently if cloud_menu_background was true, which does not make sense

Cleaning up

Add some comments

Changes:
* Add extra documentation for remove_item.

This isn't as silly as it sounds: iterate a list containing items with
unique metadata each, and remove_item the first one you find, placing
into a different - fine, except the remove will invariably remove the
wrong one, leading to items being duplicated and others destroyed.

Arguably it's a bug, and Inventory::removeItem should actually remove
the item you tell it to. (i.e. if the passed ItemStack has metadata,
match it). But it seems reasonable to just document the behaviour
more clearly.

* Improve string_to_pos documentation.
* Clarify dig_node documentation (return value).
* Better on_step documentation.
* get_nodemeta -> get_meta.

The ratios between the sizes of form elements, including text, is now
fixed, aside from variations caused by rounding.  This makes form layout
almost fully predictable, and particularly independent of player's
screen size.  The proportions of non-text elements are the traditional
proportions.

For compatibility, the way in which element positions and sizes are
specified remains unchanged, in all its baroqueness, with one exception.
The exception is that the position of a label[] element is now defined
in terms of the vertically center of the first line of the label,
rather than the bottom of the first line of the label.  This change
allows a label to be precisely aligned with button text or an edit box,
which are positioned in a centering manner.  Label positioning remains
consistent with the previous system, just more precisely defined.

Make multi-line label[] elements work properly.  Previously the code set
a bounding rectangle assuming that there would be only a single line,
and as a result a multi-line label would be cut somewhere in the middle
of the second line.  Now multi-line labels not only work, but have
guaranteed line spacing relative to inventory slots, to aid alignment.

Incidentally fix tabheader[] elements which were being constrained to
the wrong width.

Given an unusually large form, in variable-size mode, the form rendering
system now chooses a scale that will fit the entire form on the screen,
if that doesn't make elements too small.  Fixed-size forms, including the
main menu, are have their sizes fixed in inch terms.  The fixed size for
fixed-size forms and the preferred and minimum sizes for variable-size
forms all scale according to the gui_scaling parameter.

Details:
- https://sourceforge.net/p/irrlicht/bugs/433/
- https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/1687#issuecomment-61368769
- https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=9190&start=125#p159364

In case when 'settings.h' is included from 'emerge.cpp' or
'environment.cpp', u64 type has 'unsigned long' length because
previously <stdint> was included. When 'settings.h' is included from
'settings.cpp', u64 has 'unsigned long long' length because no <stdint>
was included previously. This leads to different signatures of 'setU64' method
and linker cannot find appropriate symbol.

The best fix of this bug should be done in the Irrlicht, but as hotfix I
think this is OK and better than types changing.

Previously this bug didn't appear because there was no 'settings.cpp' file and
implementation of all methods was done in the header file.
