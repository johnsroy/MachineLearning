As mbtowc(_, _, 1) reads at most one char, everything other than a
return value of 1 is an error. Since the input strings are static,
an assert protects against future changes.

Likewise, wctomb should currently never encounter a character, which
actually needs a multibyte representation.

wctomb(NULL, _) returns 'nonzero if the encoding has nontrivial shift state, or zero if the encoding is stateless.'

I assume the intentation was to get the size of the target buffer.
Use MB_CUR_MAX for this.
