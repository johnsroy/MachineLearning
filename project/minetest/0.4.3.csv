This allows the removal of nodes with unknown types.
get_item_callback() (C++) would fail if a node has an unknown type.  Now it
will try using the callback from minetest.nodedef_default in this case.
Also, minetest.node_dig() (Lua) was altered to always allow digging when
the node definition is empty (i.e. unknown node).

Opaque water's solidness was being set to 2, like a normal node.
When you swim, it is treated like a solid block, and the display
goes black.  Setting it to 1 like transparent water allows you to
see.

It looks somewhat awkward when you swim, look up, and see an opaque
wall of water (the surface), but there isn't much that can be done
about it.  If you made the water transparent so it looked good,
it would defeat the purpose :) .
