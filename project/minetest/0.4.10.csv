This reverts commit 5b518ed2feff28c9bf21ad940c1b211b72d71bd1.

This caused duplicate tracebacks and tracebacks when unwanted.
It also ignored the level argument to error() and didn't pass the message (or level) to debug.traceback().
Use xpcall() or lua_pcall()'s errorhandler argument instead.

This makes a number of changes:
* Remove the dependency on marshal by using string.dump and loadstring.
* Use lua_tolstring rather than having Lua functions pass string lengths to C++.
* Move lua_api/l_async_events.* to cpp_api/s_async.*, where it belongs.
* Make AsyncWorkerThread a child of ScriptApiBase, this removes some duplicate functionality.
* Don't wait for async threads to shut down.  (Is this safe?  Might result in corruption if the thread is writing to a file.)
* Pop more unused items from the stack
* Code style fixes
* Other misc changes
