The commit
8f9af57314f71aae1cc77e13f9996e13015d776d 'Add core.get_dir_list' by @ShadowNinja
has removed the implementation of the l_get_dirlist function and all its usages
from the l_mainmenu.cpp file, but hasn't removed it from the header file.

The reason why this hasn't been detected earlier is that C++ has this interesting
feature to still make it possible to create instances of classes whose never used
private methods are declared but not defined.

Use in-place locale directory if that exists, and
static one (RUN_IN_PLACE or CUSTOM_LOCALEDIR) doesn't exist.
Report to errorstream if neither static nor in-place locale
dirs exist, and report successfully found paths to infostreem.

Fixes two bugs:

-> Regression of commit [1] where if we use RUN_IN_PLACE=false,
but don't make install, locales aren't found. One might
think this is no regression, as its no bug, but all other
paths (mainmenu, etc.) are detected properly.
-> Regression of commit [1] where locales don't work on windows.

2. wrap some lines in doc/worldformat.txt, and point out that the node

call.

Note that this patch only enforces those boundaries for
placing entities, moving entities that move outside boundaries
aren't affected.

Thanks to @nanepiwo for pointing this out.

Commit

d2ca662569427d36642660314668e416bf68f3c8 'Enforce hiding nametag'

didn't fix the issue for 'client' instances, where the nametag update
was received before the object was added to the scene. This resulted
in the grey shadow on the nametag that commit tried to fix.

Thanks to @neoascetic for pointing out that there still is a shadow.

The invsize formspec element is outdated. Even though,
it is still supported, only a deprecation warning is shown,
introduced by commit [1]. The lua context passed to the
log_deprecated method added by commit [1] is NULL for the
invsize deprecation warning, as its run on the client and not
the server.

Commit [1] has removed checks for NULL inside the log_deprecated
method, resulting in a crash when a formspec with an invsize
element is parsed. This commit puts the check back.

Fixes #3260.

- setOpenedTrees(): this internal function was calling setSelected()
to update m_selected. Since setSelected() calls autoScroll(),
this caused the scrollbar to scroll back to the selected row
in some cases when that shouldn't be done.

For example, clicking the '+' to open a tree caused autoscroll.

Fix this by making setOpenedTrees() modify m_selected directly.

- setDynamicData(): set scrollbar position after calling
setSelected(), not before. This avoids setSelected()'s autoscroll
messing up the scrollbar position again.

- setSelected(): If an invisible row is selected, open all parents
of the selected row in order to make the selected row visible.

This fixes the issue where all the trees are closed again whenever
you return from the setting edit dialog to the settings tab.

Indeed, signed integer underflow is undefined behavior in C and C++, so while

ProfilerGraph::draw
12% -> 17.%

So yes, there is a tradeoff between saving profiling data
(executed always) and drawing the profiler graph (executed very rarely).
But usually you don't have the profiler graph open.

Cleanup:
* Remove volatile keyword, it is of no use at all. [1]
* Remove the enable_if stuff. It had no use either.
The most likely explanation why the enable_if stuff was there is that it
was used as something like a STATIC_ASSERT to verify that sizeof(T) is not larger
than sizeof(void *). This check however is not just misplaced in a place where we
already use a lock, it isn't needed at all, as gcc will just generate a call to
to the runtime if it compiles for platforms that don't support atomic instructions.
The runtime will then most likely use locks.

Code style fixes:
* Prefix name of the mutex
* Line everything up nicely, where it makes things look nice
* Filling \ continuations with spaces is code style rule

Added operations on the atomic var:
* Compare and swap
* Swap

The second point of the cleanup also fixes the Android build of the next commit.

It isn't possible to use atomic operations for floats, so don't use them there.

Having a lock is good out of other reasons too, because this way the float time
and the integer time both match, and can't get different values in a race,
e.g. when two setTimeofDay() get executed simultaneously.

The Atomic implementation was only partially correct, and was very complex.
Use locks for sake of simplicity, following KISS principle.
Only remaining atomic operation use is time of day speed, because that
really is only read + written.

Also fixes a bug with m_time_conversion_skew only being decremented, never
incremented (Regresion from previous commit).

atomic.h changes:
* Add GenericAtomic<T> class for non-integral types like floats.

* Remove some last remainders from atomic.h of the volatile use.

This adds a chat console the server owner can use for administration
or to talk with players.
It runs in its own thread, which makes the user interface immune to
the server's lag, behaving just like a client, except timeout.
As it uses the same console code as the f10 console, things like nick
completion or a scroll buffer basically come for free.
The terminal itself is written in a general way so that adding a
client version later on is just about implementing an interface.

Fatal errors are printed after the console exists and the ncurses
terminal buffer gets cleaned up with endwin(), so that the error still
remains visible.

The server owner can chose their username their entered text will
have in chat and where players can send PMs to.
Once the username is secured with a password to prevent anybody to
take over the server, the owner can execute admin tasks over the
console.

This change includes a contribution by @kahrl who has improved ncurses
library detection.

Before, sub-makes called by make were called without make knowing they
were sub-makes. This however led make's jobserver not do its tasks,
and the build process ended up with inefficient parralelisation. This
commit fixes this by applying the two ways the make manual tells
about: putting + to the start of the line (used when ndk-build is
invoked), and exchanging 'make' with '$(MAKE)'.

Before, make complained with messages like:

make[2]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.

This complaint can now only been seen for openssl. openssl has issues
if make gets exchanged with $(MAKE): if exchanged, above error message
is multiplied for various subdirs of the openssl source tree.

On a 4 core box, 'make -j 4' build time from 'make clean_all' cleaned
source tree could be improved from 15:34 minutes to 10:45 minutes.
This means a speedup of 45%.

The pageflip mode requires a stereo quadbuffer, and a modern graphic

The mini-map is not drawn, but that's what is done for topbottom and

Also most of the time the user would prefer the HUD to be off. That's
for the user to decide though, and toggle it manually.

Finally, the interocular distance (aka eye separation) is twice as much
as the '3d_paralax_strength' settings. I find this a strange design
decision. I didn't want to chance this though, since it's how the other
3d modes interpret this settings.

Backface culling is enabled by default for all tiles, as this
is how the lua parser initializes each tiledef. We revert to
always using the value from the tiledef since it is always
read and serialized.

Mods that wish to enable culling for e.g. mesh nodes, now can
specify the following to enable backface culling:

tiles = {{ name = 'tex.png', backface_culling = true }},

Note the double '{' and use of 'name' key here! In the same
fashion, backface_culling can be disabled for any node now.

I've tested this against the new door models and this properly
allows me to disable culling per node. I've also tested this
against my crops mod which uses mesh nodes where culling needs
to be disabled, and tested also with plantlike drawtype nodes
where we want this to continue to be disabled.

No default setting has changed. The defaults are just migrated
from nodedef.cpp to c_content.cpp.

Outdated servers are always sending tiledefs with culling
enabled no matter what, as the value was previously entirely
ignored.

To compensate, we must (1) detect that we're running against
an old server with a new client, and (2) disable culling for
mesh, plantlike, firelike and liquid draw types no matter what
the server is telling us.

In order to achieve this, we need to bump the protocol version
since we cannot rely on the tiledef version, and test for it
being older. I've bumped the protocol version, although that
should have likely happened in the actual change that introduced
the new backface_culling PR #3578. Fortunately that's only 2
commits back at this point.

We also explicitly test for the drawtype to assure we are not
changing the culling value for other nodes, where it should
remain enabled.

This was tested against various pub servers, including 0.4.13 and
0.4.12.

Fixes #3598

clock_gettime() is a far better clock than gettimeofday().

Even better than clock_gettime() is that you can select either
CLOCK_MONOTONIC, or even CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW. These clocks offer
high precision time. And the _RAW variant will never roll back
due to NTP drift or daylight savings, or otherwise.

I've adjusted this code to select the right clock method auto-
matically based on what's available in the OS. This means that
if you're running a very old linux version, MacOS or other,
you will automatically get the best clocksource available.

I've tested all Linux clocksources by selectively compiling and
running a 10k+ timer test suite. In all cases I confirmed that
the 3 POSIX Linux clocksources worked properly, and were
selected properly.

I've modified the OS X compile path to use the high-res clock
source for all time functions, but I can't confirm it works or
that it compiles.

As for WIN32, I confirmed that the used clocksource is indeed
a Monotonic clocksource, so good news: that code section appears
to be exactly what it should be.

I could honestly not make much sense of the timer implementation
that was here. Instead I've implemented the type of timer algorithm
that I've used before, and tested it instead.

The concept is extremely simple: all timers are put in an ordered
list. We check every server tick if any of the timers have
elapsed, and execute the function associated with this timer.

We know that many timers by themselves cause new timers to be
added to this list, so we iterate *backwards* over the timer
list. This means that new timers being added while timers are
being executed, can never be executed in the same function pass,
as they are always appended to the table *after* the end of
the table, which we will never reach in the current pass over
all the table elements.

We switch time keeping to minetest.get_us_time(). dtime is
likely unreliable and we have our own high-res timer that we
can fix if it is indeed broken. This removes the need to do
any sort of time keeping.

`print` is supposed to be able to work with anything.

This patch changes the implementation so it first converts

SetBlockNotSent or setBlocksNotSent are invoked. So in worst

I've written several experimental bits of code that revolve around the
need for a consistent calendar, but implementing one is extremely hard
in mods due to time changes and mods overriding core.get_timeofday(),
which will conflict.

The second part of the problem is that doing this from a mod requires
constant maintenance of a settings file.

An implementation in core is trivial, however, and solves all of
these problems at virtually no cost: No extra branches in server
steps, and a single branch when minetest.set_time_of_day(), which is
entirely reasonable.

We store the day_count value in env_meta.txt.

The use case is obvious: This change allows mods to create an actual
virtual calendar, or properly account for seasonal changes, etc..

We add a '/days' chatcommand that displays the current day count. No
permissions are needed. It can only retrieve the day count, not
modify it.

This privilege allows map protection bypassing for server operators
and world moderators.

Initially I had thought that bypassing protection mods would have been
something that could entirely be done inside mods and minetest_game,
but the concept of protection is defined in core, in the code of
core.is_protected().

I don't feel that it would be logical to introduce a protection
concept in core, but not some way around that for server operators
to maintain map parts that need fixing, de-griefing or cleanup.

Others had noticed the same problems, and proposed a patch to
minetest_game. That patch is fine by itself, but it fails to add
protection bypass functionality for digging normal nodes and placing
nodes.

So, instead, we indroduce the new priv 'protection_bypass' in core,
and modify 'on_place_node' and 'node_dig' to allow bypassing node
protections if the player holds this priv.

This priv was tested with protector redo by tenplus1.

A followup patch to Minetest Game will include allowing special checks
for doors, trapdoors, chests in Minetest Game.

Protection mods will likely want to mimic the changes in their relevant
code sections.

We introduce a new nodebox type 'connected', and allow these nodes to
have optional nodeboxes that connect it to other connecting nodeboxes.

This is all done at scenedraw time in the client. The client will
inspect the surrounding nodes and if they are to be connected to,
it will draw the appropriate connecting nodeboxes to make those
connections.

In the node_box definition, we have to specify separate nodeboxes for
each valid connection. This allows us to make nodes that connect only
horizontally (the common case) by providing optional nodeboxes for +x,
-x, +z, -z directions. Or this allows us to make wires that can connect
up and down, by providing nodeboxes that connect it up and down (+y,
-y) as well.

The optional nodeboxes can be arrays. They are named 'connect_top,
'connect_bottom', 'connect_front', 'connect_left', 'connect_back' and
'connect_right'. Here, 'front' means the south facing side of the node
that has facedir = 0.

Additionally, a 'fixed' nodebox list present will always be drawn,
so one can make a central post, for instance. This 'fixed' nodebox
can be omitted, or it can be an array of nodeboxes.

Collision boxes are also updated in exactly the same fashion, which
allows you to walk over the upper extremities of the individual
node boxes, or stand really close to them. You can also walk up
node noxes that are small in height, all as expected, and unlike the
NDT_FENCELIKE nodes.

I've posted a screenshot demonstrating the flexibility at
http://i.imgur.com/zaJq8jo.png
In the screenshot, all connecting nodes are of this new subtype.

Transparent textures render incorrectly, Which I don't think is
related to this text, as other nodeboxes also have issues with this.

A protocol bump is performed in order to be able to send older clients
a nodeblock that is usable for them. In order to avoid abuse of users
we send older clients a 'full-size' node, so that it's impossible for
them to try and walk through a fence or wall that's created in this
fashion. This was tested with a pre-bump client connected against a
server running the new protocol.

These nodes connect to other nodes, and you can select which ones
those are by specifying node names (or group names) in the
connects_to string array:
connects_to = { 'group:fence', 'default:wood' }
By default, nodes do not connect to anything, allowing you to create
nodes that always have to be paired in order to connect. lua_api.txt
is updated to reflect the extension to the node_box API.

Example lua code needed to generate these nodes can be found here:
https://gist.github.com/sofar/b381c8c192c8e53e6062

NDT_CONNECTED attempts to connect to any side of nodes that it can
connect to, which is troublesome for FACEDIR type nodes that generally
may only have one usable face, and can be rotated.

We introduce a node parameter `connect_sides` that is valid for
any node type. If specified, it lists faces of the node (in 'top',
'bottom', 'front', 'left', 'back', 'right', form, as array) that
connecting nodeboxes can connect to. 'front' corresponds to the south
facing side of a node with facedir = 0.

If the node is rotatable using *simple* FACEDIR, then the attached
face is properly rotated before checking. This allows e.g. a chest
to be attached to only from the rear side.

2. Clear the connects_to_ids before deserializing.

With each new connected node, the deserialization code added more
and more targets to the map, since the map wasn't cleared in between
deserialization steps. This caused e.g. wall blocks to connect to
things in the fence connects_to map.

Fix two bugs related to the reconnect feature
introduced by commit

3b50b2766aeb09c9fc0ad0ea07426bb2187df3d7 'Optional reconnect functionality'

1. Set the password to the stored one

Before, we have done the reconnect attempt with a
cleared password, so using the feature would only
work if you had an empty password.
Thanks to @orwell96 for reporting the bug.

2. Reset the reconnect_requested flag after its use

the_game only writes to the reconect_requested flag
if it sets it to true. It never sets it to false.
If the flag is not reset after its use, all 'reset's
to the main menu will look like the server had
requested a reconnect.

The legacy init packet (pre v25) sends information about the client's
password that a server could use to log in to other servers if the
username and password are the same. All the other benefits of SRP of
protocol v25 are missed if the legacy init packet is still sent during
connection creation.

This patch adds an option to not send the v25 init packet. Not sending
the v25 packet means breaking compat with pre v25 servers, but as the
option is not enabled by default, no servers are affected unless the
user explicitly flips the switch. More than 90% of the servers on the
serverlist support post v25 protocols.

The patch also fixes a bug with greying out of non compliant servers
being done wrongly, the min and max params were mixed.

Before, customisation of DOCDIR did not lead to
changes of the EXAMPLE_CONF_DIR default value.
This was inconsistent with expected behaviour
if you didn't know of the existence of the
EXAMPLE_CONF_DIR variable. The confusion is
very strong, as (for not in place builds) both
DOCDIR and EXAMPLE_CONF_DIR share the same
default value, it is unexpected that setting
CUSTOM_DOCDIR changes the location of all
documentation files but one.

The best meaning of EXAMPLE_CONF_DIR is to
further allow customization of the mt.conf.example
storage place, but otherwise keep defaulting to
whatever DOCDIR is set to, at least for not in
place builds. This patch implements that
behaviour.

Fixes #3863.

ABM's are hardcoded to run every 1.0s, NodeTimers are hard coded to
run at every 1.0s. Block mgmt is running every 2.0sec.

However, these timers can be better tuned for both higher and lower
values by server owners. Some server owners want to, and have the
resources to send more packets per second to clients, and so they
may wish to send smaller updates sooner. Right now all ABM's are
coalesced into 1.0 second intervals, resulting in large send queues
to all clients. By reducing the amount of possible timers, one can
get a far better response rate and lower the perception of lag.

On the other side of the camp, some servers may want to increase
these values, which again isn't easily doable.

The global settings abm_interval and nodetimer_interval are set to
current values by default. I've tested with 0.2/0.5 type values
and noticed a greatly improved response and better scattering of
nodetimers, as well as enjoying not faceplanting into doors with
pressure plates anymore.

they cause a nodeupdate, we just keep walking until it ends. On
the way back we prune the tail.

@SmallJoker has noted a bug that servers from the (local) main menu
favorites list can't be opened.

This commit fixes the bug by disabling any main menu based protocol
checks for servers from the favorite list.

Also, it fixes a second bug that happens when a server from the
public serverlist doesn't send its supported protocol versions,
most likely because its running a minetest older than commit [1].
Then we have shown an error msg that the server has enforced
one specific protocol version. This was most likely not the case.

Of course, we can't do anything better than do an assumption on
the protocol versions if they are not known. That assumption
should however be closest to the most often occuring case as
possible.

Also, some little cleanups.

Before, the GridNodes were stored in vector<vector<vector<T>>>,
and initialized in advance. Putting three vectors inside each other
puts lots of unneccessary stress onto the allocator, costs more memory,
and has worse cache locality than a flat vector<T>.

For larger search distances, an the array getting initialized means
essentially O(distance^3) complexity in both time and memory,
which makes the current path search a joke. In order to really
profit from the dijkstra/A* algorithms, other data structures
need to be used for larger distances.

For shorter distances, a map based GridNode storage may be slow as
it requires lots of levels of indirection, which is bad for things like
cache locality, and an array based storage may be faster.

This commit does:

1. remove the vector<vector<vector<T>>> based GridNodes storage that
is allocated and initialized in advance and for the whole
possible area.

2. Add a vector<T> based GridNodes storage that is allocated and
initialized in advance for the whole possible area.

3. Add a map<P,T> based GridNodes storage whose elements are
allocated and initialized, when the path search code
demands it.

4. Add code to decide between approach 2 and 3,
based on the length of the path.

5. Remove the unused 'surfaces' member of the PathGridnode class.
Setting this isn't as easy anymore for the
map based GridNodes storage.

The path finding code works fairly well except that it considers
anythin not CONTENT_AIR to be 'above the surface'. This results in
paths that are unwalkable for entities since e.g. plants are not
walkable. The path would force them to jump on top of grass plants,
etc..

The obvious solution is not to use CONTENT_AIR as a criteria, but
instead distinguish between walkable and non-walkable nodes. This
results in paths that properly walk through grass nodes.

This was extensively tested by a flock of electric sheep.

Note that for underwater purposes this changes the behaviour from
'the surface is walkable' to 'ignore water entirely' making the
path go across the water bottom, and pathing fail likely from the
water surface. This is intentional.

The change keys dialog can't be left. It doesn't make
much sense to show it on Android in the first place,
therefore disable it, just like commit

aed70cb0b652d6cb2272e7b94cd56671b3df6239 'Disable sound and key binding settings in 'pause' menu on android'

has disabled it for the esc menu.

Fixes #4115.

Fixes #2122
Fixes #1454

Addendum (est31)
According from its docs in android_native_app_glue.h (from the NDK), the
onInputEvent should 'Return 1 if you have handled the event, 0 for any
default dispatching'. Before, we always returned 1, meaning we blocked
all hardware keys to be given to the OS.
This broke the volume keys and has caused #2122 and #1454.

Although it bases on lots of guesswork, it can probably safely be said that
CGUIEnvironment::postEventFromUser returns true if the event was handled,
and false if not. Therefore, set the status variable depending on what
postEventFromUser returned.
