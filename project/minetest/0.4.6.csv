the following:
1. String concatenation in guiMainMenu.cpp - it is required for all
individual strings to be of the same type <unicode/non-unicode>; adding
explicit L qualifier before the other strings.
2. Correcting type of BlockMakeData to struct in place of class forward
declarations. This information is used for name decoration by Visual
Studio, leading to linker errors in case of mismatches.
3. Windows headers define max as a macro somewhere, leading to a compile
time error in profiler.h; using () around function to prevent macro match
from occurring.

When first entering an area, sometimes placing nodes replaces other nodes that are not buildable_to. This seems to be caused by the fact that nodes in unloaded map blocks are treated as ignore, a node that is buildable_to. This fixes that, by using get_node_or_nil() instead of the previously-used get_node(), then checking to see if the nodes were actually loaded before replacing.
