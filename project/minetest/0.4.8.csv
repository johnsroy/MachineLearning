TextureSource has a list of textures to delete (m_texture_trash) so this
provides a proper, non-hacky way to delete RTT textures. Also, the prior,
hacky way of deleting them seems to be broken (see pull request #803).

To avoid header file clutter by repeating the same long list of
arguments over and over again, store the arguments of
generateTextureFromMesh in a struct called TextureFromMeshParams.

Also fix issue #782 (Only use bilinear (and others) on item textures
when settings allow it).
