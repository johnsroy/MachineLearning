This greatly increases crafting performance, especially in worlds with many mods.

Approved by @kwolekr.

Introduces a hash-type-layered fall-through mechanism, where every layer specifies one hash algorithm,
and the 'deeper the fall', the more collisions to expect for the algorithm. One Craft definition
only resides at one layer, which improves speed for lower layers (and a complete fail), due to most
craft definitions residing at high layers.

Due to the fall-through design, the undocumented behaviour that later craft recipes
override older ones had to be weaked up a bit, but craft recipes with the same hash and layer
will still override.

similar issue when builders didn't fetch new tags when updating.

This also removes the number-of-commits-since-tag field, since it's
incompatible with this.  Said field doesn't seem to be useful anyway if you

```
Package libjpeg8-dev is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
However the following packages replace it:
libjpeg62-turbo-dev
```
Using libjpeg-dev should make the OS select the most appropriate lib to be installed.
These are the packages available on Debian 8.
```
libjpeg-dev - Development files for the JPEG library [dummy package]
libjpeg-turbo-progs - Programs for manipulating JPEG files
libjpeg-turbo-progs-dbg - Programs for manipulating JPEG files (debugging symbols)
libjpeg62-turbo - libjpeg-turbo JPEG runtime library
libjpeg62-turbo-dbg - Debugging symbols for the libjpeg-turbo JPEG library
libjpeg62-turbo-dev - Development files for the libjpeg-turbo JPEG library
libturbojpeg1 - TurboJPEG runtime library - SIMD optimized
libturbojpeg1-dbg - TurboJPEG runtime library - SIMD optimized (debugging symbols)
libturbojpeg1-dev - Development files for the TurboJPEG library

https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/libjpeg-dev
https://packages.debian.org/jessie/libjpeg-dev
https://packages.debian.org/stretch/libjpeg-dev

Im not sure if Ubuntu has this dummy package.

Perhaps this should be further discussed.

Before, our libiconv build was a joke. We first called configure for our own build host system,
then called make, before we executed a Android.mk script we provided as patch. The first 'native make'
always failed, and the LIBICONV_LIB file setting in our Makefile didn't match the built one,
resulting in an always-rebuild of iconv.

This commit cleans up this total mess, removes the double-build, and the Android.mk, and properly calls
./configure with the according target platform, and uses a built toolchain.

As we have to deal with the android bug 'NDK: Support for prebuild libs with full sonames'
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=55868
as the 2013 patch
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libtool-patches/2013-06/msg00002.html
by Google's David Turner wasn't inside the 2011 libtool, we pass -avoid-version to
libtool.

Thanks to the proper build, wide_to_utf8 works for android now, removing us of the need to disable it.

Speeding up rebuild:

Before, we've written the android_version.h file at every rebuild.
As it thought the file's content has changed, make has rebuilt files
in the source tree that depended on that header file during rebuild,
causing lots of files being rebuilt without there being a reason.

The reasoning of make can be observed by passing -d and V=1 params
to the ndk-build command. You then got logging entries like:

Prerequisite `jni/src/android_version.h' is newer than target `obj/local/armeabi-v7a-hard/objs-debug/minetest/jni/src/areastore.o'.

Preventing race condition build fail:

Before, there was a race condition, where, if the prep_srcdir target
was executed in parallel with the $(ROOT)/jni/src/android_version.h
one, it could happen that the jni/src directory was nonexistent, and
we were trying to write into a file inside. This resulted in a build
failue:

/bin/sh: 1: cannot create [...]/jni/src/android_version.h: Directory nonexistent

Additionally, we now don't remove the link to src/ needlessly anymore.
Keeping this wouldn't have affected the rebuild, but this way its
more proper.

Before, this lua code led to a crash:

local pcg = PcgRandom(42)
local value = pcg:next()

This was because if you called s32 PcgRandom::range(min, max) with the
minimum and maximum possible values for s32 integers (which the lua
binding code did), u32 PcgRandom::range(bound) got called with 0 as the
bound. The bound however is one above the maximum value, so 0 is a 'special'
value to pass to this function. This commit fixes the lua crash by
assigning the RNG's full range to the bound 0, which is also fits to the
'maximum is bound - 1' principle, as (u32)-1 is the maximum value in the
u32 range.
