This causes textures to be deleted before they are no longer accessed,
resulting in a segmentation fault. This needs to be rewritten in such a way
that textures are deleted when the client disconnects from a server.

This reverts commit 41c00e87d42580881d8c7001f39014814e3b55f2.

Clients no longer have to be near an object when an animation or attachment is set to see the changes, and newly connected clients (or a client that simply renders the object for the first time) will get all of those settings. Therefore, the lua script no longer needs to run every X seconds either, just once per entity.

Finish fixing the material color code. But it won't work until MineTest has dynamic lighting... another day another feature.

Extra checks for the bone positioning / rotation code

Many checks and consistency improvements to the client attachment code

Make a separate function for checking if a client object is attached. A more in-depth change will be needed here to fix reading of invalid pointers

Use a different method of fetching the parent. Fixes the mass segmentation faults when rendering an attachment (some still happen though)

Major change to how attachments are handled. Fix the last segmentaton fault, which was due to the parent becoming invalid while being refreshed / removed which would bause the child to remain attached to nothing. Parents remove their children when being deleted themselves and add them back when re-added. Attachments are stored inside a 2D a vector which easily allows both a child to find their parent and a parent to find its children.

Remove attachment list entry when an object is being permanently removed. Also avoid duplicate entries in this list when re-attaching the same object

The 'big code comments' can now go away. Client attachments almost work properly, and I know what else needs to be done

Fix the last segmentation fault (apparently). So far attachments seem to be fully functional, although removing the parent causes children to go to origin 0,0,0 and possibly still cause such a fault (though this should already be addressed)

Fix a bug in falling code where entities get stuck

Also check if the parent has been removed server-side, and detach the child if so. Fixes children going to origin 0,0,0 when their parent is removed.

Unset all attachment properties when permanently detaching (on both the client and server). Also store less data we don't need

Create a separate function for detaching, and also update lua api documentation

When a child is detached, update its position from the server to clients. This WILL cause it to get positioned slightly differently client side, as the server attachment system only copies parent origin and knows not about mesh / bone transformation. This prevents different clients seeing the object detached in different spots which is most correct

Update the position of attached players to clients. An attached player will see himself move, but this is currently VERY ugly and laggy as it is done by the server (it probably must stay this way too)

Use a different approach for locally attached players. This allows for smooth positio transitions to work, as well at the player turning around freely. Still buggy however

This is not a problem on POSIX systems (these directories are
ignored by the POSIX implementation of fs::GetDirListing() in
filesys.cpp), but these directories still are reported on Windows
systems.  This becomes a problem when mod authors use version
control systems that create directories like '.git' or '.svn'
and collectMods() picks up on them.  It has also been suggested
that ignoring such directories would allow for the easily disabling
mods by inserting a '.' in front of their name.

This quick fix simply makes collectMods() ignore directories
beginning with a '.'.
