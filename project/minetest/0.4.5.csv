settings.h: added function to return all keys used in settings, and a
function to remove a setting

mods.{h,cpp}: added class ModConfiguration that represents a subset of the installed mods.

server.{h,cpp}: server does not load add-on mods that are disabled in
the world.mt file. mods are disabled by a setting of the form
'load_mod_<modname> = false'. if no load_mod_<modname> = ... setting
is found, the mod is loaded anyways for backwards compatibilty. server
also complains to errorstream about mods with unstatisfied
dependencies and about mods that are not installed.

guiConfigureWorld.{h,cpp}: shows a treeview of installed add-on mods
and modpacks with little icons in front of their name indicating their
status: a checkmark for enabled mods, a cross for disabled mods, a
question mark for 'new' mods

Mods can be enabled/disabled by a checkbox. Mods also show a list of
dependencies and reverse dependencies. double-click on a mod in
dependency or reverse dependency listbox selects the corresponding
mod. Enabling a mod also enables all its dependencies. Disabling a mod
also disables all its reverse dependencies.

For modpacks, show buttons to enable/disable all mods (recursively,
including their dependencies) in it.

Button 'Save' saves the current settings to the world.mt file and
returns to the main menu. Button 'Cancel' returns to main menu without
saving.

basic keyboard controls (if the proper widget has keyboard focus):

up/down: scroll through tree of mods
left/right: collaps/expand a modpack
space: enable/disable the selected mod

All uses of operator[] in guiConfigureWorld.cpp have been replaced
with .find() operations.

In some places, operator[] had been called with mod names of 'Add-Ons'
or 'N/A', which would insert a default-constructed ModSpec into the
list of add-on mods. In other places, the use of operator[] was safe
now, but it probably is safer for future changes to use .find()
everywhere.

"b9d8e59bbf727fcc1a073bbf27e5d1703b9490ef","2013-02-13 22:43:15-05:00","Add emerge.cpp, initial EmergeThread changes

- Neatly placed all emerge related code into a new file, emerge.cpp
- Greatly cleaned up the code in EmergeThread::Thread()
- Reworked Emerge queue.  Now an actual std::queue of v3s16 block positions
- Removed the completely unnecessary map of peer ids requesting blocks
