This happened when working in the emulator. Open the calendar,
add a new Event with standard values (only enter a description)
and click done. A new Notification will pop up with this newly
created event. Click on it, and then on the Eventdetail.
A NPE will occur, because the mCalendarOwnerAccount seems to
be null in the emulator. Now the variable is reset to ''
if it is null (like the initial value). When there are attempts
to save this variable, there's already a check if != '', so it will
not be stored. The other calls to this variable are only .equals()

Commit b9cd34a9b6622045cfac73d1497f4e5d745601d3 in AOSP master removed
the call to ContactsAsyncHelper's private constructor, which initialized
the static HandlerThread. This causes an NPE when loading contact photos
in appointments.

Readded the static initializer to restore this functionality.
