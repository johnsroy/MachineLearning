The 'location' field of a calendar Event is expected to hold a
location, but sometimes holds a phone number.  The framework's
Linkify code looks at '1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, 94043' and decides
that '94043' is a phone number, which isn't great.  As part of
bug 3328309, linkification of phone numbers was disabled for the
location field.

We now let Linkify look for non-phone-number items, and then use
the fancy libphonenumber routines in a second pass for more reliable
phone number detection.

If we find what looks like a phone number inside a URL, we ignore
it (i.e. we defer to Linkify when we detect an overlapping span).

If notifications are turned off we should dismiss our notifications.
If notifications are turned on we should clear all unhandled

We had a case where we could request a substring of -1 length. This
puts a protection around it and fixes the bug that caused the bad

Some changes to the code that renders cells on the tablet month view:

- Font heights were computed with ascent only.  Now descent is
included as well.
- Padding constants that implicitly included font descents have been
trimmed to compensate.
- Font metrics are rounded to the nearest integer rather than
truncated.
- The 'vertical space required' computation didn't match the rendering
code, causing us to show one fewer event than we could in certain
cases (e.g. portrait view with 5+ events).

The layout itself hasn't changed at all -- what we draw now is a
pixel-for-pixel match with what we had previously.

Two changes to the way that events are presented in the tablet
month view.  First, we no longer show the times for each event
(which appear on a second line, roughly doubling the vertical space
consumed) unless we can do so for all events on that day.  Second,
all-day events now get a full-width rectangle to make them easily
distinguishable from non-all-day events.

Also, the decision for whether to use framed vs. filled boxes is
made based on whether the attendee status is INVITED, rather than
NONE (the former indicating an invitation you haven't responded to,
the latter indicating you created an event for yourself).  This
brings the month view behavior in sync with the week view.

- Fixed the same when picking a home time zone

- Improve performance by lazily generate all the display time zone names.
