Also all actions directed to the service will be forwarded to the mediaplayer part in a new thread, making the player much more responsible. Layout improvements on the widget and notification were made. Also at importing a book the player doesnt check for the file length any more which makes importing a book kind-of-instant. A check for files without duration is done by the BookChooseFragment. So at the moment because of the locked database the app may freeze till all length are found. This has to be fixed (maybe a waiting screen on startup combined with a lock specifing the book that is being updated. Sorry for the long long long single commit, but I had to change everything at every point
