The build.xml script was failing if there wasn't already a gh-pages
branch in the local git repo.

Changes:

Fetch the origin/gh-pages branch.

Create a temporary 'gh-pages-tmp' branch using origin/gh-pages as the
starting point.  And then as before, copy the changelog to the branch,
push the branch back to origin, and finally delete the temporary branch.

Added more comments to the script.

This isn't the best solution. Most of the developers agree that a right-aligned
triangle or arrow would be a better fit for such an indicator. But we currently
don't have the time to write the code to do it.
Personally, I think we should try to get rid of submenus altogether.
