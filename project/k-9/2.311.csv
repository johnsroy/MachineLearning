Fixes Issue 806

Make sure to close opened folders in finally blocks in
MessagingController.

Don't make another connection when deleting or copying a
message.  (Nicely speeds up copy and delete, as well.)

Another connection is still created for creating a folder while
copying or deleting (a pretty rare event), and the IMAP IDLE
connections are not re-used for user initiated activity.
