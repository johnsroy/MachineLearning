* master: (28 commits)
Updated MIME Type list with http://www.stdicon.com/mimetypes

Bumped manifest to ${version.name}
Fix phantom messages in unified inbox.

Bumped manifest to ${version.name}
first pass at importing the traditional chinese translation from Issue 2500 ( thanks to zhangyin@research.neu.edu.cn)
notification that the dataset changed needs to happen on the UI thread.
When returning from a messageview to a messagelist do our listview updates on a thread rather than on the main ui thread. it results in the list blinking with old data, but that's still a better user experience than 'frozen'
astyle
update a comment about an uncommon code path
Add gmail-style 'to me' and 'cc me' indicators in messagelist
When doing a message search, break it into 'first 10' and 'more' - because a long SQL query takes more time before starting to return results, K-9 was increasingly slow on large folders.
Running heavy operations on the UI thread makes K-9's UI slow and freezy.  addOrUpdateMessages is very heavy. and very common.
Corrected small typo
Update issue 7031 http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=7031 added removeDialog() for every dismissDialog()
Same as r2450 Rename strings-sv.xml to strings.xml (Android ignores the actual file name, rename is for consistency)
Revert 'For the common case of 'getMessage' where we actually have the object in'
Calculate preview for html-only messages
