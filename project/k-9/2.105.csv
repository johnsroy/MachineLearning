1) Actual message sync on MessagingController uses same connection as
IDLE for faster and more efficient push operation.  Uses fewer
connections to the server.

2) More aggressive handling of untagged responses should more reliably
get flag changes and new messages when many events happen at once.

3) Simplification of new mail notification

4) Push mail now respects the folder visible limit

5) When multiple untagged FETCH responses arrive en bloc, the actual
message flags and UIDs are fetched with a single request
