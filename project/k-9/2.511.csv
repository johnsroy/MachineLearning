a) is already known if the server supports the NAMESPACE capability.
b) is included in the prefix anyway (=also known if namespace was set manually).
c) isn't needed when selecting a mailbox because we currently don't support folder hierarchy. So the delimeter is included in the folder name.

Handle CAPABILITY response in following cases:
1) When sent as part of the banner, no longer sends explicit
CAPABILITY command

2) When sent as an UNTAGGED response to LOGIN, updates stored
capabilities.

3) When sent as part of the TAGGED response to LOGIN, updates stored
capabilities.

Due to odd implementation of the CRAM-MD5 authentication, the
capability updates will not happen as part of the CRAM-MD5
authentication.

Apparently some servers got the 'be liberal in what you accept from others' part of the robustness principle wrong. When we used multiple calls in writeLine() (command + CR + LF) a separate TCP packet was send each time. It appears that those broken servers accepted the DATA command after DATA + CR and interpreted the LF as part of the actual data. This caused our headers to become part of the body because that LF was interpreted as the empty line that separates headers and body.
As a side effect of this fix sending mail could be slightly faster now due to less packets being sent.

Big thanks to Kevin Newland of Michigan Technological University for organizing a test account.
