Fixes Issue 1562

Issue 1474:
Provide new facility to totally wipe all data for an account but leave
settings intact.  This is useful because sometimes storage is so full
that SQLite cannot perform the usual VACUUM or message deletion.

Add confirmation dialogs to destructive Clear and Recreate operations.

Remove destructive Clear from FolderList so as not to have to
duplicate the confirmation dialogs.

Issue 1562:
Suppress notifications when new messages arrive in Trash, Sent or
Drafts special folders.

Fixes Issue 1577

Issue 1551:
Some IMAP servers send untagged EXPUNGEs to IDLEing
clients without ever haven't sent an untagged FETCH.  The untagged
EXPUNGEs are harder to deal with because they don't have a UID.  So,
if the user has elected to have the IDLE connection start with a poll,
we can maintain a map of message sequence numbers to UIDs that we can
use to figure out which message to delete.  To mitigate the risk of
the map falling out of date, we do a UID SEARCH UID before removing
the local copy of the message, just to make sure the message is really
gone from the server.  If we detect an error, do another poll to
resync the map.

Issue 1577:
Restore the removal of notifications for an account when the account's
unread message count goes to 0.

Utilize cketti's AutoSyncHelper in order to provide a way to make K-9
Mail obey the global Auto-sync setting.  K-9 Mail doesn't obey the
Auto-sync setting by default because K-9 Mail isn't listed as one of
the listed applications.

Simplify WakeLocks use by pushing.

Correct fault in IMAP IDLE WakeLock usage.  The ThreadLocal in

the DONE was sent was not being released when entering back into IDLE
