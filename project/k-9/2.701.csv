Not done, yet, but available for developers to use.

Definite things to be done in the short term:
1) Allow user to hide canned searches in Accounts Activity
2) Make newly arrived mail immediately appear in search results.

Possible improvements:
3) User-definable searches
4) Make newly deleted mail immediately disappear search results.
5) Make message with flag changes immediately appear/disappear from
search results.
6) Show search result size in Accounts Activity.

Look for + as acknowledgement that we're in IDLE mode, not 'idling'
string.

Also, to help with battery life:
1) Give up trying to IDLE after 10 failures.
2) Increase retry delays

Computing the account size is pretty slow for big accounts, and making
this functionality optional should be considered.

Also, displays the number of flagged messages ('stars') in each
account in the Accounts list and each folder in the FolderList.  Needs
better presentation of the flagged message counts, but this works as a
proof-of-concept and gets the data structures built.

Present flagged message count inside a star, matching the visual
presentation on individual messages.

Provide display of unread and flagged message counts for canned
searches.

Perhaps the message counts for searches and account size display
should be defeatable for improved speed.
