* mail-on-sd: (40 commits)
Added more comments to explain how the locking mecanism works for LocalStore
Fixed wrong method being called during experimental provider initialization (since provider isn't enabled, that didn't harm)
Add more comments about how the various StorageProviders work and how they're enabled
find src/com/fsck/ -name \*.java|xargs astyle --style=ansi --mode=java --indent-switches --indent=spaces=4 --convert-tabs
French localization for storage related settings
Remove unused SD card strings (replaced with storage indirection)
Merge mail-on-sd branch from trunk
Reset mail service on storage mount (even if no account uses the storage, to be improved)
find src/com/fsck/ -name \*.java|xargs astyle --style=ansi --mode=java --indent-switches --indent=spaces=4 --convert-tabs
Migraion -> Migration
move the Storage location preference into preferences rather than the wizard.
Made LocalStore log less verbose Added @Override compile checks
Added ACTION_SHUTDOWN broadcast receiver to properly initiate shutdown sequence (not yet implemented) and cancel any scheduled Intent
Be more consistent about which SQLiteDatabase variable is used (from instance variable to argument variable) to make code more refactoring-friendly (class is already big, code extraction should be easier if not referencing the instance variable).
Added transaction timing logging
Factorised storage lock/transaction handling code for regular operations.
Use DB transactions to batch modifications (makes code more robust / could improve performances)
Merge mail-on-sd branch from trunk
Update issue 888 Added DB close on unmount / DB open on mount
Update issue 888 Back to account list when underlying storage not available/unmounting in MessageView / MessageList
