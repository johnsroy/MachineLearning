MessageHeader rendered the subject line by default, and only after
MessageTitleView decided it was large enough to display the entire
subject line, the subject line was hidden again. This caused a noticable
flicker during message rendering while navigating with next/previous
message buttons.

This commit flips the logic, only displaying the subject view once the
title view finds it can't display it all.

This commit removes use of LocalFolder.MessagePartType as an indication
of part types in AttachmentInfoExtractor. The enum was intended as a
caching mechanism to skip loading unimportant parts from the database,
but only the reading side was implemented. As the expected performance
gain is negligible, I disabled the reading side for now (computing the
data instead) and more explicitly disabled the writing side as well.

This commit introduces the AttachmentResourceProvider as a layer of
abstraction between K9WebViewClient and the message Part structure,
which allows moving all K9WebViewClient handling into MessageWebView
itself (making the class package-local).

It also fixes display of uncached inline attachments, e.g. in a Forward
operation called from the context menu.
