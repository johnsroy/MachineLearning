Previously messages in the local Trash folder were marked as deleted,
then deleted from the server. During the next sync the placeholders for
deleted messages are removed from the database.
Obviously this doesn't work for POP3 accounts because the Trash folder
can't be synchronized with the server. So, for POP3, we now immediately
clear out all messages in that folder.
