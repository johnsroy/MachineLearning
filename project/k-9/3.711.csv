- Added AUTOMATIC as a new authentication method that will automatically choose the best authentication method (basically old behavior with CRAM_MD5). All other options will now enforce the selected authentication method.
- Added LOGIN as selectable option.
- Cleaned up code so strings to the different authentication methods are only defined once.

Configure the CharsetDecoder to throw an exception if malformed input
is encountered. Not doing this can cause an endless loop that
allocates memory until the application dies with an OutOfMemory error.
Until we have support for both a folder display name and a raw folder
name we simply ignore folders with names that aren't correctly encoded
with the modified UTF-7 variant.

Fixes issue 3268

Credits: Bernhard Redl (aatdark) analysed the problem and wrote the
initial version of the fix.
