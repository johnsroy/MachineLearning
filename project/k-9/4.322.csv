The commit that introduced those notifications also introduced a rather
... interesting design pattern: The CertificateValidationException
notified the user of its pure existance - it's no longer a 'message'
only, but defines policy. As this is more than unusual, replace this
pattern by the MessagingController treating
CertificateValidationException specially when accessing remote folders.

Also make clear which account failed when constructing the notification.
