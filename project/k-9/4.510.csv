If you attempted to use SSL to connect to a server that speaks
STARTTLS, you should get an SSL protocol error.  Instead, you
were likely to get an 'Unrecognized Certificate' error that shows
you an unrelated certificate chain and asks you to accept it or
reject it.  Neither action would work because the actual problem
had nothing to do with certificates.  The unrelated certificate
chain that popped up had been statically stored when validating
a prior connection to a different server.

With this patch, certificate chains are no longer stored statically
when validating server connections.

Issue 5886 is an example of a user experiencing this problem.

The new method is a little bit janky, but a little bit of jank is better than 2n

On my 200 folder account, display of the folder list activity drops from 10+s to
