"a86354be7dfdedeeef9985a2c6d7de6493a08ee7","2012-11-12 23:41:06+01:00","Treat mailto-URI parameters case-insensitive

RFC 6068 defines these parameters case-insensitive, yet we only
supported lower-case values because the method Uri.getQueryParameters()
treats parameter names case-sensitive.
This patch introduces a wrapper class that implements case-insensitive
parameter name matching.
