The previous approach (generating the view in the adapter) kills performance
because list views cannot be recycled anymore, as soon as the user scrolls to
the bottom of the list. The Android ListView widget already provides support
for list header/footers, so use them.

Fixes downloading attachments (would just fail silently)

Also added a ProgressDialog since progress() just asks for
progress to displayed in the title bar. Since there is no title bar,
no progress is shown at all.
