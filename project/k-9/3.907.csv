The SAX parser returns chunks of text to the
WebDavHandler. Other tags were correctly appending
values while the special cased <uid> tag was
simply assigned the value it was given, which would
result in the last chunk assigned to it and not
the whole string of text.

Dynamically update the FolderList titlebar when the unread state of a
listed folder changes.  This implementation applies the folder unread
count delta to the account-level unread count, to avoid the expense of
recomputing the entire account's unread count.  If no FolderInfoHolder
for this folder already exists, skip the recomputation of the
account-level unread message count.
