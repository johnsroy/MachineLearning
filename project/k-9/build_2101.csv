r51837@31b (orig r127):  ismarc31 | 2008-11-10 19:10:50 -0500
Experimental branch for Exchange WebDAV support

r51838@31b (orig r128):  ismarc31 | 2008-11-10 19:24:52 -0500
Initial proof-of-concept code for WebDav support

r51839@31b (orig r129):  ismarc31 | 2008-11-10 22:02:37 -0500
Fixed a couple of migration issues and enabled WebDav as a mail type

r53269@31b (orig r132):  ismarc31 | 2008-11-21 21:55:55 -0500
Mostly rewritten class and organization.  Better implementation of message fetching.
Consolidated response parsing.  Removed a large number of redundant calls.  There is still
some unused functions needing cleaning up, and some unimplemented actions

r53338@31b (orig r133):  ismarc31 | 2008-11-22 16:50:02 -0500
Removed more redundant and unused calls.  Implemented checking read status

r53453@31b (orig r134):  ismarc31 | 2008-11-24 20:13:24 -0500
Added support for marking messages as read.

r53454@31b (orig r135):  ismarc31 | 2008-11-24 22:04:04 -0500
Added support for deleting messages server side

r53455@31b (orig r136):  ismarc31 | 2008-11-25 01:32:19 -0500
Improved flag setting functionality, do bulk HTTP request instead of lots of little ones

r53589@31b (orig r138):  young.bradley | 2008-11-29 16:18:25 -0500
Missing some ports (webDavPorts); this causes an array index out of bounds exception when anything other than 'None' or 'SSL (Optional)' are selected.

Adding the three additional ports solves this issue.
r53590@31b (orig r139):  young.bradley | 2008-11-30 00:47:42 -0500
Initial support for sending via WebDav
r53591@31b (orig r140):  ismarc31 | 2008-11-30 20:12:41 -0500
Fix for display names being URL Encoded for folders.  Initial support of Uid Hashmaps instead
of plain arrays.

r53592@31b (orig r141):  ismarc31 | 2008-11-30 21:46:06 -0500
Fix to constructor of HttpGeneric(final String uri).  URLs returned from Exchange aren't
always fully encoded, this fixes the encoding before creating the method.

r53593@31b (orig r142):  ismarc31 | 2008-12-01 02:22:16 -0500
Completed support for using hashmaps instead of arrays for indexing urls to emails and read
status.  Delete is safe again and read status is correct the first time through.

r53594@31b (orig r143):  ismarc31 | 2008-12-01 22:20:50 -0500
Fix for double-Inbox display issue.  Removed volumous amounts of Log.d messages.

r53644@31b (orig r157):  young.bradley | 2008-12-04 15:14:28 -0500
Fix for wildcard certificates (e.g. issued to *.example.com).  Only checking the
trust of the certificate itself, since apparently the full chain causes it to
not work.
r53765@31b (orig r161):  ismarc31 | 2008-12-06 18:55:08 -0500
Implemented new functionality for pulling message envelope.  Uses a WebDAV call for all messages rather than parsing the stream.  Message size is properly set now as well.

features are added to K9mail:

1) Show unread message count on each folder
2) Sum unread count of all shown folders in an account to the account display
3) Periodically check selected folders for new mail, not just Inbox
4) Don't refresh folder when opened (unless folder is empty)
5) Show date and time of last sync for each folder
6) Fix timer for automatic periodic sync (use wakelock to assure completion)
7) Optimize local folder queries (speeds up account and folder lists)
8) Show Loading... message in status bar indicating which folder is being synced
9) Eliminate redundant sync of new messages (performance enhancement)
10) Improve notification text for multiple accounts
11) Do not automatically sync folders more often than the account-specific period
12) Use user-configured date and time formats
13) Select which folders are shown, using configurable Classes
14) Select which folders are synced, using configurable Classes
15) Added context (long press) menu to folders, to provide for Refresh
and Folder Settings
16) Status light flashes purple when there are unread messages
17) Folder list more quickly eliminates display of deleted and out-of-Class folders.
18) Delete works
19) Mark all messages as read (in the folder context menu)
20) Notifications only for new unread messages
21) One minute synchronization frequency
22) Deleting an unread message decrements unread counter
23) Notifications work for POP3 accounts
24) Message deletes work for POP3 accounts
25) Explicit errors show in folder list
26) Stack traces saved to folder K9mail-errors
27) Clear pending actions (danger, for emergencies only!)
28) Delete policy in Account settings
29) DNS cache in InetAddress disabled
30) Trapped some crash-causing error conditions
31) Eliminate duplicate copies to Sent folder
32) Prevent crashes due to message listener concurrency
33) Empty Trash
34) Nuclear 'Mark all messages as read' (marks all messages as read in
server-side folder, irrespective of which messages have been downloaded)
35) Forward (alternate) to allow forwarding email through other programs
36) Accept text/plain Intents to allow other programs to send email through K9mail
37) Displays Outbox sending status
38) Manual retry of outbox sending when 'Refresh'ing Outbox
39) Folder error status is persisted
40) Ability to log to arbitrary file

approach should guarantee that the syncing never stalls just because a
single attempt exceeds the (currently 10 minute) WakeLock timeout.  At
the sync frequency, K-9 will wakeup again and refresh the WakeLock for
another go at syncing.  This should make synchronization much more
reliable in the face of slow or unavailable connections, in particular
ones which hit the socket read timeouts.

Also, fixed the audible notifications so that the ringtone selected
is always for one of the accounts with new unread mail.

Developers now have the option to turn on a fast-flashing LED during
synchronization in order to observe whether synchronization is
happening while the handset is apparently asleep.  I think this option
would be aggravating to non-developer users.  See

Significant hardening of the email sending process.

A given message in the Outbox is only attempted to be sent 5 times.
Once the threshold is reached, the message is flagged.  asses through
the Outbox skip flagged messages.  The message can be tried again by
manually unflagging.  When any messages are flagged during a pass
through the Outbox, K-9 raises a notification with a fast flashing red
LED, alerting the user to the failure to send.  A note is also placed
in the K9mail-errors.

The read timeout on SMTP connections has been changed to 300000ms (5
minutes)

The send attempt counter is kept in memory, not stored with the
message, so a phone or application restart will clear the counters,
but not the flagged state.  As the intent of this revision is to avoid
runaway message sending, this is deemed to be acceptable for now.

The moving of messages from the Outbox to the Sent folder has been
changed to an atomic move.

Extra error checking has been added to the SMTP communication code.

The flashing LED may be excessive.

Hardening of POP3 and SMTP communication:

SMTP: Decrement failure counter when no possible message send
occurred.  This way, K-9 will only stop attempting to send messages
for which a possible successful send occurred, but K-9 could not
detect.  Any message that is known to have completely failed to send
will be reattempted indefinitely.

POP3: Some reworking of Exception handling.  Also, if it is not
possible to get a 'message number' for the UID of the message that is
being deleted, conclude that the message has already been deleted on
the server.  Mark this as a permanent error, so that it gets removed
from the pending actions queue.

MessagingController: Look for the permanentFailure flag on the
MessagingException, and if a pending action raised a permanent
failure, remove the pending action from the queue so that it will not
be re-attempted nor block later requests.

Issue 192

Do not remove markers for deleted messages, even if the corresponding
remote message is not returned by the remote store.  The remote
message may not be returned simply because the query did not encompass
it on this run.  If the account's delete policy is set to 'Do not
delete from server', or the delete hasn't succeeded before a folder
refresh, a message for which the deleted marker has been removed can
errorneously reappear.

This will lead to the local store eventually having a large number of
deleted message markers.  In the long term, we'll need a way to manage
and possibly automatically remove them.

Issue 252

394: Replace code change lost with move of DAmail MailService.java to
K-9.  Eliminate the stopSelfs.  Without the stopSelfs, the Service
remains active and the Android platform is far less likely to kill the
process, although not absolutely forbidden from doing so.  Better will
be to implement the full BroadcastReceiver methodology referred to in
Issue 394, which would allow replacing the stopSelfs, which would make
K-9 a better good citizen.

252: Fix logic for raising and canceling notifications based on number
of new unread messages and total unread messages.

Fix POP3 deletes.  Verizon uses - in their POP3 UIDs, and K9 was
assuming that only Local UIDs have -.  Removed that assumption.  Also,
after issuing DELE on POP3 connection, need to also issue a QUIT.  The
delete code in MessagingController now closes the folder after
deleting a message, which will slow down IMAP deletes, but also
conserve connections, so is probably a net benefit.

Try to get folderlists to sort in a stable way, so they jump around less in the ui
r63349@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-13 20:37:19 -0400
Switch to using non-message-passing based notifications for redisplay of message lists, cut down redisplay frequency to not overload the display
r63432@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-16 13:38:49 -0400
Android 1.5 no longer gives us apache.commons.codec by default and apache.commons.logging by default. Import them so we have em.

r63450@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-16 22:34:18 -0400
Default to pulling items out of the LocalStore by date, descending. (since that's the uneditable default ordering)
This makes our messages come out of the store in the order the user should see them
r63451@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-16 22:34:44 -0400

r63458@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-17 13:10:07 -0400

gete -> get (typo fix)
r63573@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-22 22:48:49 -0400
First cut of a global prefs system as well as a theme preference. not that it works yet
r63577@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-24 14:49:52 -0400
Once a user has actually put in valid user credentials, start syncing mail and folders in the background instantly.
This gives us a much better 'new startup' experience

MessageList doesn't need FolderUpdateWorker
r63579@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-24 17:57:15 -0400

Cut down LocalMessage creation to not generate a MessageId or date formatter.
r63589@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-24 22:22:32 -0400
Switch to null-escaping email address boundaries, rather than a VERY expensive URL-encoding
r63590@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-24 22:23:21 -0400
Clean up our 'auto-refresh the list when adding messages after a sync'
r63593@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-24 22:53:45 -0400
replace isDateToday with a 'rolling 18 hour window' variant that's more likely to give the user a useful answer and is 30x faster.
r63595@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-24 23:54:14 -0400
When instantiating messges from the LocalStore, there's no need to clear headers before setting them, nor is there a need to set a generated message id
r63596@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-24 23:54:39 -0400
make an overridable setGeneratedMessageId

Remove new lies from comments
r63598@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-24 23:55:35 -0400
Replace insanely expensive message header 'name' part quoting with something consistent and cheap that does its work on the way INTO the database
r63605@17h:  jesse | 2009-05-25 17:28:24 -0400

Issue 30

Provide support for multiple identities.  Identities can be managed in
the Account Settings.  While composing a message, an identity can be
chosen for sending.  Identity information and signature edits are
saved in a header field, so that they survive being synced to the
server and back.

Provide support for editing the quoted text, either for replies or
forwards.  The quoted text is immediately editable, in a separate
editor from the main body.  When saved in a draft, the two are
contatenated, but the length of the main body is saved with the
identity information, and is used to split the two parts again, when
opening the draft.

Fixes Issue 577

K-9 has earned its Canine Good Citizen.

K-9 now respects the Android-global Background data preference, by
default.  However, there is an override, allowing K-9 to ignore the
global preference, by either always running around and synchronizing
in the background, or staying put and not synchronizing.

A user can now elect to turn off mail synchronization across all
accounts in either the K-9 Preferences page by setting Background
synchronization to Never, or leaving that value as 'When 'Background
data' is checked' and deselecting the Android-global Background data
preference.

Fixes Issue 394
Fixes Issue 763

Completely new Services architecture providing proper Service
lifecycle management.
Long running tasks in MailService are executed in a separate thread,
but the service is not stopped until the tasks are complete.

SleepService for providing synchronous sleeps with proper WakeLock
integration.

Mail polling logic moved from MailService to PollService

PushService to keep application from being killed while push is
running.

Improved logging of IMAP protocol, including logging folder name,
thread and connection hashcode.

Don't put a failed connection back into the IMAP mConnections
storage.

IMAP IDLE uses new SleepService for delaying between failed connection
attempts (allows phone to sleep and provides better reliability)

Use a ThreadLocal for ImapPusher wakelocks

Component enablement/disablement in Email is done only when components
are out of phase with desired state. (Issue 188)
