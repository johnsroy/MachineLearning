Remove the fadeout to make things look a little less weird
Make the animations slide in from the edge. (See the aforementioned comment about jankyness)

TODO: don't remove the message view until _after_ the animation runs. Before HC, that requires rather a lot more code (writing a whole animationadapter) than it should.

TODO: get the messageview to stop jumping to hide the header area as it's displayed.

When MessageListFragment is on the back stack and the device is rotated
the instance state will be restored but no new view will be created. If
the device is rotated again onSaveInstanceState() is called and we have
to take care not to assume that the views have been created.

- The attachments view still had the wrong background color in case
of different global and message themes.

- The attachments view used the activity LayoutInflater, but it needs
to use the one of the fragment.

- The background drawable for the attachments used transparency, and
thus was completely invisible in the black theme. Fix it by adding
another one for the black theme.

The ContextThemeWrapper added in a74d57cb71d67e42e1db709e00d5fd514b1ecd0c
used getActivity().getApplicationContext() to get the base context.
This is wrong, because an Application context won't work for starting
activities from the WebView.

Instead, use the context that is given to us in the constructor as base
context. This is the one that would also  be used if no ContextThemeWrapper
was present at all.
