The standard ScrollView causes problems when selecting text (and the message is long enough so scrolling is possible). The newly introduced ToggleScrollView can be set to disable scrolling via touch gestures thus making copying multi-line text sections possible.

for sorting. This will prevent spam with ...less true dates from pushing
messages to the top of your list. Additionally, when downloading
messages from the server, they'll actually appear in the order they were
received - the existing behaviour really screwed up users who were
trying to triage mail as it came in.
