- Removed the contact names cache (memory leak)
- Changed Contacts.searchByAddress() to Contacts.getNameForAddress(). Cursor is now immediately closed.
- Only try to resolve contact names when 'Global settings' -> 'Show contact name' is checked
- Never resolve contact names if number of recipients exceeds a threshold
