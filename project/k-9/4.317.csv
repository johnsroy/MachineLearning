This changes the interface to MessagingController and the way flags are
updated in the database. Now messages aren't changed one by one but in
batches of 500. This should give better performance, but breaks the
unread and flagged count. I'm not very sad about this, because now we
can move towards only displaying the number of unread/flagged messages
in the local database.

Currently only the Accounts activity uses the new count.

While working on this I realized that the unread/flagged search for
accounts currently looks for unread/flagged messages in all folders, not
all displayable folders without special folders (Trash, Spam, Outbox,
Sent, Drafts) like we used to.
Also, the 'All messages' search currently doesn't limit the search to
searchable folders like it is supposed to.
