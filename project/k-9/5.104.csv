This should restore the original functionality. So saving messages in the
database should work fine again.

Using
<meta http-equiv='Refresh' content='1; URL=http://example.com/'>
in a HTML message causes WebView to load the URL in the default browser.
Overriding WebViewClient.shouldOverrideUrlLoading() allows us to cancel
loading this URL. Sadly, I found no way to find out whether the method was
called because of a meta refresh or because the user clicked on a link.

So now we're using HtmlCleaner to parse the HTML and remove all 'meta' elements
containing an 'http-equiv' attribute with a value of 'refresh'.
