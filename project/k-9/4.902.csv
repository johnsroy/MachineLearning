Since id is a Long, Long.valueOf(long) unboxed the Long to a primitive
long, then reboxed it into a Long instance, which was again unboxed to
allow it to be set as an element of the array of longs. This commit
reduces the number of boxings from 3 to 1.

The loop extracted keys from `folderMap` and then called
`folderMap.get(...)` for every key. If both the key and the value needs
to be iterated on, `Map.entrySet()` is a more efficient solution as it
doesn't require O(n) Map lookups.
