Our previous implementation of UID FETCH didn't ever take into account
maximum command line lengths. When fetching, say 800 messages from a
GMail IMAP server, we could easily overflow the max line length leading
to a fetch that didn't get all the messages we wanted to and was
truncated before the description of which fields we want. That caused
K-9 to fetch complete messages, exhaust memory and ultimately fail,
even when we were just trying to get message lengths.

An equivalent fix needs to be made to seach by UID.

Update issue 1916
Status: started

I updated the existing strings.xml with many of your fixes and added a Canadian French specific strings.xml: it only contains terms that differ.

Identified terms (fr / fr_CA) :
e-mail / courriel
spam / pourriel

You can now choose 'Fran√ßais (Canada)' language from the configuration screen.

I tried to match the Gmail application running on a system configured with French locale: it mainly use the 'message' term and sometime 'e-mail' like in notifications as well as 'spam'.
Some other modifications are spelling fixes.
