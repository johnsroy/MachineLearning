Removed dependency from K9 to MessageProvider (and added ability for components to register themselve for being notified when K9 instance is ready)
Moved Intent broadcast code from MessageProvider to K9
Made query() easily extensible using strategy pattern, the discriminant still being the Uri path

"f6064ff19f12b08b8c2ddba83c96f73dfb5ff19f","2010-10-02 07:45:11+00:00","Use a thread pool to optimize resource usage instead of always firing up new threads (less garbage collection).
Note: this is not a complete revert of r2153 since the pool is now automatically expanded as needed (different implementation).

Status: Fixed
Extracted Intent.ACTION_SENDTO handling in a separate block to extract data from URI (as opposed to ACTION_SEND which uses Intent extras to pass data)

- Don't instantiate an empty Address array just to throw it away (less gabarge collection)
- Use a StringBuilder rather than a StringBuffer (faster as it isn't synchronized)
