The patch would cause an extra SMTP connection on _any_ meesage with
attachments. Marcus is headed away on holiday and asked me to revert it
for him (after I asked him to revert it) - With luck, we'll talk through
a design to work around this issue on the list

Switched MessageList from singleTask to singleInstance launchMode
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2417468/android-bug-in-launchmode-singletask-activity-stack-not-preserved

This makes launched activities to initiate a new task, they have to
handle the BACK key if user has the option enabled. On the other hand,
K-9 still keeps a single instance of MessageList (as opposed to using
the default launch mode which would allow multiple instances -
potential increased memory usage).

Remove memory leak from referencing MessageView context from the
Intent that is created to go back to MessageList. MessageView is no
longer hardcoded to go back to MessageList, it instead uses an Intent
given at creation to get back to the originating Activity.

Try our best to restore the MessageList in its previous state when
'Manage BACK button' option is enabled:
Since MessageList lives in its own task, we look for the previous
active task and check whether its top activity matches it. If it does,
we just finish MessageView and Android will automatically restore the
previous task. If it doesn't, we launch the originating Intent (and
MessageList state will be lost).

If option is off, we get the regular Android behavior: got back to the
previous screen, whenever it's the MessageList or another application
if the user long-pressed HOME.

The consequence of this is the need for a new permission in order to
check the previous active task: android.permission.GET_TASKS
