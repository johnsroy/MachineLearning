Calling configureMenu() inside updateMenu() doesn't update the
buttons properly. Instead, call invalidateOptionsMenu(). This forces
the menu to be re-created, and onPreareOptionsMenu() to be called.
From there, configureMenu() is called automatically.

Some people prefer them over swiping / volume keys.

They could probably be made optional so they can be hidden.

Also: delete the now unused message_view_fragment.xml and message_view_option.xml.

- Since the split-view change, MessageView is only a fragment, so we
can't call setTheme() anymore so easily.
Instead, use a ContextThemeWrapper and use that to inflate the
layout. This way the message header and attachment view
are styled correctly.

- The HTC WebView fix in SingleMessageView was returning the wrong
background color, when message view theme and global theme differ,
because it always used the global theme to retrieve it.
Fix: Specifically put the light/dark values in the themes.xml,
and get them using getContext().getTheme().resolveAttribute().
getContext() will use the ContextThemeWrapper from above, so
even if the global and message view themes differ, it aleays
returns the correct one.
The getThemeBackgroundColor() method added to the K9ActivityMagic
interface in 309eeb72ac3c4fb2b93766550eed24e5cab39bb8 is now not
needed anymore, and was removed.
