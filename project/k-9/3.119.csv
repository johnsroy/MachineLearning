Message retrieval:
- Use the given projection for the cursor result instead of always using a predefined projection. Extraction logic is now in dedicated classes for easy extension.
- Added BaseColumns._ID & BaseColumns._COUNT columns.
- Deprecated 'id' column since it's not a reliable identifier (it's an incremential value generated at query() time)
