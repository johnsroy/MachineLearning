Previously, it was possible to have 'Require sign-in' unchecked and a

tap 'Next' because of a hidden (and irrelevant) 'Authentication = Client
certificate' setting.

Check that the user has actually chosen a client certificate in
AccountSetupOutgoing.validateFields().

Also, there's no need to clear the password and certificate fields when
hiding them.  The user may accidentally change settings and want to change
them back without wiping out the existing settings.

The referenced issue states that it is only applicable to Android < 4.2
(testing confirms the problem on 4.1.2, but not on 4.2.2).

A test was added for the version code, primarily as a finder's aid for a
day when K-9 Mail no longer supports Android < 4.2 and the work-around can
be removed.

The referenced issue also states that it is only necessary to hold a
reference to the first PrivateKey retrieved. (Testing indicates that the
problem is avoided so long at least one reference is always maintained to
a PrivateKey -- it doesn't actually need to be a continuous reference to
the first PrivateKey.)

From my understanding, a normal class loader never unloads a class, so the
static reference can be safely kept privately in KeyChainKeyManager.

With this commit, KeyChainKeyManager no longer throws the exception and
AccountSetupCheckSettings no longer catches it.

It was being thrown when the server requested a client certificate but no
client certificate alias had been configured for the server.

The code was making the incorrect assumption that the server would only
request a client certificate when such a certificate was *required*.
However, servers can be configured to accept multiple forms of
authentication, including both password authentication and client
certificate authentication.  So a server may request a certificate without
requiring it.  If a user has not configured a client certificate, then
that should not be treated as an error because the configuration may be
valid and the server may accept it.

The only indication that a certificate is *required* is when a
SSLProtocolException is thrown, caused by a SSLHandshakeException
resulting from a fatal handshake alert message received from the server.
Unfortunately, such a message is fairly generic and only 'indicates that
the sender was unable to negotiate an acceptable set of security
parameters given the options available.'  So there is no definitive way to
know that a client certificate is required.

Also, KeyChainKeyManager.getCertificateChain() and getPrivateKey() no
longer throw IllegalStateException().  These methods are permitted to
return null, and such a response is appropriate if the user has deleted
client certificates from the device.  Again, this may or may not cause the
server to abort the connection, depending on whether the server *requires*
a client certificate.

when the command for authenticating with SASL EXTERNAL fails.

that there's an authentication problem that needs addressing.

The problem:  begin modifying the server settings by changing the security

to a custom value, then change screen orientation.  The default port value
is restored, wiping out the custom value.

When onRestoreInstanceState() is called, the custom port value is
restored.  But the spinner doesn't actually restore its state at that
time.  Instead, it waits until View.layout(), at which time it posts a
runnable to call onItemSelected() if the restored state doesn't match the
state initialized in onCreate().  When onItemSelected() is eventually run
sometime later, it wipes out the custom port value that was restored.

The solution is to keep track of the spinner state ourselves and only
revert the port to a default when we see the spinner state changed by the
user.

This problem goes back to 4.904 and before.

The constructor now saves the certificate chain, so the code to retrieve

getCertificateChain() is no longer needed.

The constructor now retrieves and saves the private key so that any
resulting errors are detected sooner.

Methods that retrieve the alias perform checks to assure that the client
cert. satisfies the requested issuers and key type.  It's known that
Sendmail may provide a list of issuers in its certificate request, but
then may authenticate against a much larger set of CAs, but then later
reject the mail because the client certificate was not acceptable.
Vetting against the issuer list helps detect such certificate problems
sooner (upon connection) rather than later (upon transmission of mail).
Earlier error detection is necessary so that errors may be presented to
the user during account setup.

SslHelper has been removed, and its functionality has been transferred

createSocket() is invoked.

A new instance of SecureRandom is no longer passed to SSLContext.init().
Instead, null is passed.

The (default) provider of the TLS SSLContext used is OpenSSLProvider,
which provides an SSLSocket instance of type OpenSSLSocketImpl.  The only
use of SecureRandom is in OpenSSLSocketImpl.startHandshake(), where it is
used to seed the OpenSSL PRNG with additional random data.  But if
SecureRandom is null, then /dev/urandom is used for seeding instead.

Meanwhile, the default provider for the SecureRandom service is
OpenSSLRandom, which uses the OpenSSL PRNG as its data source.  So we were
effectively seeding the OpenSSL PRNG with itself.  That's probably okay
(we trust that the OpenSSL PRNG was properly initialized with random data
before first use), but using /dev/urandom would seem like a better source
(or at least as good a source) for the additional seed data added with
each new connection.

Note that our PRNGFixes class replaces the default SecureRandom service

levels anyway.  (It also makes sure that the OpenSSL PRNG is properly
