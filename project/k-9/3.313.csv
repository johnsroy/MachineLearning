- extracted handling of external intents to a new method
- only allow mailto URI for ACTION_VIEW and ACTION_SENDTO (as documented by AOSP)
- allow additional recipients via 'to' parameter in mailto URI
- removed check for allowed MIME type when adding attachments since we're accepting all MIME types anyway
- show CC and BCC text fields when one of those recipient types was set by the intent
- use MIME type specified in intent for attachments (if present and doesn't contain a '*')

more obvious to end users.

Split out the 'choose identity' icon from the 'cc' icon, though they're
still the same image, at least they're logically separate
