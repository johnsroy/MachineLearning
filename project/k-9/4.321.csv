This removes the default settings (ellipsized, single line) from the layout
xml file and implements them programmatically.  This fixes the problem where:
You are viewing a folder list while wrapping is currently on, then you go into settings
and turn wrapping off, after which you are back at the folder list, but the
list is still wrapped.
