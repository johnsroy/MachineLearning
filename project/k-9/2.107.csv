Comment #7 on issue 819 by jessev: Hide empty CC: lines in Message View
http://code.google.com/p/k9mail/issues/detail?id=819

My intent is to default to showing Subject. Date and From or To (depending   on whether you're the sender) with a button/widget/hyperlink/something to fold down   and show more detail.
