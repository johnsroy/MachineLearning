If the message isn't worth showing immediately, it is not worth
saving!

(Don't save a message unless we get at least a non-null subject and
non-null sender during first pass sync.)

Implements new setting 'Sync remote deletions' which is checked by
default.  When unchecked, K-9 Mail will no longer remove messages from
local storage just because the message was removed from the server.
This functionality works for all account types.  Messages will still
be removed from the local store in order to stay within the limit
imposed by the 'Number of messages to display' setting.

Correct thread safety on some member variables when doing null checks.

Explicitly check for mMessageCount == -1 and stop=true in idling loop.

However, the original error message 'Message count = -1 for folder'
will still arise in some circumstances and is a valid error to
report.
