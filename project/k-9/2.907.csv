Update issue 662
We tried out the long press for a bit and deemed it too sensitive for general usage. It can cause problems with gestures and such, so I removed it again. I hope using the option menu is not too much overhead.
If you want to include it in your custom build or anything, then r 1976 and r1977 should be enough.
