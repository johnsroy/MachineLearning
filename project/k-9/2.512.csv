Worked performed by danapple0 and cketti in

Add support for most batch ops (except move and copy) in search
results.  Add support for batch move and copy on real folders.

Increase efficiency of bulk IMAP moves and copies by doing as multiple
UID operations.

Eliminated serialization of Account objects.

Provide up-references in useful places to make all future code cleaner
and more efficient.

Fixed a bunch of draft handling

Merged from issue1116 branch, except for Account.java, which was
copied wholesale.  Account.java was manually merged in issue1116

Implement DEFLATE compression for IMAP communication, enabled by
default.  User can disable compression for Wi-Fi, Mobile, or Other
networks, if it causes problems or if uncompressed communication is
faster, which is possible on Wi-Fi and wired networks, especially.

'Other' is to allow for the Android platform to introduce new
networking types without having to immediately change K-9 Mail.
However, as those arise, new network types should be added as explicit
types in K-9 Mail.

Provides for the user to elect to have certain folders displayed first
in the FolderList.  Folders so elected are displayed in alphabetical
order first, then folders not so elected are displayed alphabetical
order.

No special handling is done for Inbox any more, except that it is in
'top group' by default, to preserve current behavior until the user
changes the settings.

Allow user to turn off gesture-based control.

Also, consolidate so that gestures could be used by other subclasses
of K9Activity.  Probably should be made usable to K9ListActivity, too,
by making MyGestureDetector its own class and make it used by
K9Activity and K9ListActivity, and have the Activities implement a
callback interface for onNext and onPrevious.
