The point of this commit is to remove the deep layers of nested conditionals
inside showNotification(). This will make this member easier to read and
improve. I do this by removing unnecessary conditionals and reversing/returning
conditionals as required.

This commit also removes the try/catch block which encompassed the entire
method. If we crash MPDroid because we're not handling exceptions, we need to
handle them and not paper over the problem, IMHO.

MPDroid's old behaviour when adding the album, artist or title to the
notification panel is if it's null the notification panel would print the
string 'null' to the notification panel.

The new behaviour checks for the field first, then is either omitted, as is the
case with album or artist, or is substituted with filename in the case of
the title tag.
