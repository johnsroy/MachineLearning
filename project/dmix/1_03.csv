opposite to what it used to be, this so that items have a consistent
meaning in all BrowseActivity and so that it can be inhereted from
there.

The need for musicList is because it can somehow differ from items,
unshure how this can be but there is an if-statement in the
asyncExecSucceeded method that checks again if it really got a list
containing the search words, mpd isn't doing a good job?

Added an Add Override to pick the right song and only that song, using
the generic one from BrowseActivity could pick several songs with
similar names across albums becuase it just searches all over the
library.

Added an Add with index to be able to reuser the else common code
between add and the pluslistener in asyncExecSucceeded (tho I have no
idea what hte pluslistener actually does)

inhariting from it.

There is an UpdateList method that the classes should call at the end of
theire onCreate method, this method will call the asyncUpdate method in
an async thread, in there the classes should populate the item list with
what it wants to have end up in the list and BrowseActivity will take
care of that part and generate the menus.

Modified all classes to follow this behavior

Added an Add method to FSActivity so that long-press and the menu there
will work for both files and folders.
