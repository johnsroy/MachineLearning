commit checks the current track for non-nullity prior to updating the remote

Album, uses many different types of construction and, it's getting harder to
construct, so a builder is natural for construction.

This patch:

* Removes setHasAlbumArtist(), this was required to make all fields immutable,
and work with the builder pattern.

* Moves the getAlbumDetails() method from the MPD classes to addAlbumDetails(),
this will be less confusing as it's a superset of addAlbumPaths().

* This removes the findYear parameter from addAlbumDetails(). The information
was already being retrieved, just not placed in the album object.

* The current track must not be null.

* Either a artist name or an album name must be available in the current track.
This will be a runtime error if one or the other is not available.

* This commit also changes QueueFragment to check for artist or album prior to
calling removeAlbumById() to properly handle any errors.

* After this commit we rely on the MusicList map to have the music item. The map
should be stable now, though, if we find that it's not, this will have to be
modified to revert the behaviour.

This abstract class creates a thread-safe map of MPD key/value responses with

A few advantages to this approach:

* Far fewer fields per class.

* Value processing is done as necessary.

* No need to process and store every response value, to be used or not.

* This class was designed with concurrency and thread safety in mind, unlike
the older classes used to implement similar results.

* This allows easy mass value resetting, duplication, modification and
comparision.

* Value processing will be done in many smaller methods, making processing
easier to read and write and encouraging more robust processing.

* Included methods accounts for all necessary exceptions to convert to
primatives and Objects, and handles errors as required.

** The URI fragment is now removed from the filename during call to getFilename().

** This also adds a method to get the actual name tag information. Because of a
method naming conflict, this could have been hidden by the filename due to

it should be implemented with the idle subsystem and not directly in the

There should be no case where a command should be non-retryable. The only
theory for this is probably that a command is sent, response isn't received

and even if it WERE to happen I would expect it to be so amazingly rare
that this hack shouldn't be warranted. I can, pretty safely, say this
cannot happen with connections being what they are; there are tons of

- Fix Z order on pre 5.0
- Fix Text style (use material design standards)
- Make list items a little smaller (72 -> 68 dp)
