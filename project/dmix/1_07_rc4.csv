This fixes a regression with 4b7c035 where the album would be added without an
artist being specified. This also adds a helper method, no documentation as
this code is likely to be rewritten prior to next release.

If the headphone plug is pulled, it's a likely expectation that the user no
longer wishes to stream.

This should fix an inconsistency bug where if a stream was playing, and the
stream would be stopped by the checkbox during buffering, the stream would
continue playing and there would be no way to control stopping it without
killing the instance.

This fix is essentially the same thing as before, only slightly more strict.

The GenreFragment has always added it's items externally from JMPDComm, this
patch incorporates the functionality and adds support for findadd/searchpladd.

This commit fixes a regression from ef2484a where playlist files were given a
position as a song id, since they don't have a natural unique id by design.
This didn't make sense from a JMPDComm standpoint, so it got removed. Then I
found the regression which playlist track removals required a unique songid
so, this patch implements playlist file track position as a UID in MPDroid.
