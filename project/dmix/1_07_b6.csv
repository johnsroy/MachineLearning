This is really no different than pulling the plug out of the earphone socket,
we pause on that, so we should pause on this as well. The only thing that is
substandard about this is this server might have other listeners. This is the
only sane thing to do in this case, though.

In this implementation, we implement a lazy and deaf audio focus for
NotificationService. If another music service takes the focus, then we're not
going to request it until next Notification restart or notification button
press, as we don't want to start interrupting local audio playing with remote
MPD users.

Right now trying to stream again after an error is causing more problems
than it's fixing. Disable and perfect later.
