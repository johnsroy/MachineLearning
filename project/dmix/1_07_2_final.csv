We've been getting automated crash reports where the album key is not included
in a list response line, this is probably due to an empty list or possibly an
invalid server response line. During repair, I noticed we're doing a lot of
unnecessary work with regard to album listing, so this patch fixes that at the
same time.

We've received a crash report showing that upon playlist changes response that
a songPos was not received with an entry. This is a protocol error. This patch
works around that behaviour for if it ever happens we'll simply reload the
entire playlist.

This changes the startActivityForResult to return a result so that
getCallingActivity() will work.

This fixes a bug where if a user had the popup open then another client cleared
the playlist (or the playlist cleared due to consume), THEN the button was hit
with a null current song, a crash would occur.

Yet another attempt to fix the RCC recycle bug. This patch changes the
behaviour to always completely reset the remote control client when adding
artwork. This patch might not work, but it certainly couldn't make things
worse. This will either get improved upon later or reverted.

Remove the NetworkActivityHandler. It was an idea whose time was not ready for
MPDroid. Some of this code might be resurrected once the core connection code
is repaired, but for the most part I expect this code to be radically
different.
