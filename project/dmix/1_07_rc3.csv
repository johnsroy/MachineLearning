We've received a couple of automated crash reports which no exception was thrown
and no result was received. This is probably a bug of some sort. Having the user
crash isn't going to help, throw an IOException for now, until the bug is either
found or the code is replaced.

This refactoring fixes quite a few issues, some causing internal inconsistency
which has been in this class since existance.

* When the inner list is manipulated, do not remove the old music entry from
the inner list. This removal will occur at a later iteration of the changeset,
if it needs be. This caused a bug which would cause an exception when adding
or changing in the middle of the inner list.

* Remove unused methods and constructors. There were a lot of unused methods
that would no longer have any use and would add to the maintenance of this
class. Since this class is for internal use only, we don't need to worry about
feature methods.

* Move the list iteration to manipulate(), it's better suited for the task.

* Cleanups everywhere, including the workaround from f232f5f has been
refactored.

* Replace map with list. Our songID map has /never/ worked correctly, due to
the way it was constructed. Replace it with an easier to maintain list.

* Use sublist() to clear ranges.

* Implement Iterable.

We received a crash report detailing a crash that occured due to a null
mFullPath field. This really shouldn't happen, but since it apparently does,
cover it with an if block like the rest of this class. This /could/ be fixed
with the constructor fix (detailed below); cover it up until possibly post-
release testing.

While looking into this bug, I also noticed the children classes for the Music
class are inexact constructors. For instance, we would construct the children
with getTitle() which is /not/ a getter. Use a better suited constructor and
change permissions so it won't happen again.

We received a automated crash response due to an attempt to send an empty

never added to the command queue. For this case, I've added a conditional
which should be negated if there is an empty command queue at the end.

First, let me start by saying this code change makes no logical sense, that I
can tell.

This issue is, intermittently, if state is changed quickly enough, the state
change wouldn't show.

After a few hours of bisection I traced this down to:
e0d9799:JMPDComm/src/main/java/org/a0z/mpd/MPDStatusMonitor.java:107

When this line is removed, and the code is replace with code that result in
the same code result (hard coded or otherwise) the state changes just as it
should. This is not a cloning issue, the state is not modified in MPDCommand
(and I could reproduce it post-cloning). Since I've only been able to reproduce
this in Android 5, so my wild assumption is that this is a bug in ART; but it's
easy enough to workaround that this patch is a trivial non-issue.
