The game calls scePsmfGetEPWithTimestamp(), but without any chapters.
This means nothing is written to its pointer.  But it takes the value
there anyway.

It happens that the value there is 0, but only because something wrote it
to the stack before the call.  It seems like scePsmfVerifyPsmf() is the
one writing it, since it has a different value shortly before that call.

So, as a workaround, just write some 0s into the stack.  Games without
bugs should not care.  Hard to predict what will happen to another buggy
game.
