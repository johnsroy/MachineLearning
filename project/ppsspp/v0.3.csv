Picks the first Xinput device available, waits 100 frames between

Controls are hardcoded so every x360 controller button corresponds
to the PSP button in the same physical position. Input from right
stick and from analog triggers is ignored.

The Xinput code though is overriden by SampleControls' hardcoded
keyboard input. XinputDevice was tested to work with

Add an std::list to WindowsHost that, curretly, contains
a hardcoded list of preferred `InputDevice`s. Devices
are tried in-order until one of them reports success.
Xinput is preferred over Keyboard. Keyboard always
returns success. Pointers are stored in the std::list
for polymorphism.

Change XinputDevice to report failure as soon as a
device can't be queried, instead of only a frame later.
