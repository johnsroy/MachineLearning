Add missing #include to various files.

strings.h isn't provided by MSVC so we don't include it there; it's needed
for other OSes/compilers.

Get rid of pre-ISO-C malloc.h includes; malloc is provided by stdlib.h.

Fixes some linuxisms.

Prepend __builtin_ to __clear_cache, calling it without the prefix is a
GNU extension.

Tested on Windows with NMake Makefiles and Visual Studio 11 targets.
Tested on Linux with GNU Makefiles target, using GCC as the compiler.
Tested on FreeBSD using clang as the compiler.
Tested for Android on Windows with NMake Makefiles and r8c NDK.

Proxy-tested by xsacha for blackberry.

The android build requires that the android/android.toolchain.cmake
toolchain file is used; an error will be raised if ANDROID is defined
without loading the toolchain file.

When targeting ANDROID, the resulting .so files will be placed in
'android/libs/$ANDROID_ABI' even when building out of tree, since it's
where `ant` expects to find them.

Since the Core library is expected to be named 'ppsspp_jni' on ANDROID,
we also put its name in a variable that is set to 'Core' unless building
on ANDROID, where it is 'ppsspp_jni'.
