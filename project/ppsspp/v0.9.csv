It's a HUGE hack right now, and needs to be properly rewritten so that allocation and stuff work better. This is based off the work of BlackDaemon, and I added in the auto check to switch the code on/off depending on if the game is a remaster or not. It does not affect or break any games that I know of.

Return better responses for errors (should allow weird God Eater Burst saves from real PSPs to not bounce back to the titlescreen). Not sure why some God Eater Burst saves would send bad jpeg data. The data sent through sceJpeg is supposed to be a normal jpeg (ie it should be perfectly viewable in photoshop or whatever image viewer/editor). The reason it doesn't send a good, decodable jpeg should still be researched but in the meantime let's not push users getting that error back to the titlescreen. Returning getYCbCrBufferSize(0, 0) on error seems like it would be more correct as well (or, at least God Eater Burst recognises that as an error unlike 0xC000...I didn't think that error code was right but no saves gave me bad jpeg data before).

I guess the colour info address isn't supposed to be updated if the jpeg errors out, or I think so based on reports from the God Eater Burst thread in the forums. This shouldn't affect working jpegs since the address is still being updated before returning, just not if it errors out. If this doesn't work for the save from the forums, it would have never worked in PPSSPP builds up to today (it basically makes the function _only_ return null without updating the colour address, making it the equivalent of the only implementation other than mine, which was a stub, if it errors out). The previous commit I made worked in the Japanese version, but still bounced back in the US version (wtf?).

Based on tests on a PSP, all branches are attempted.  The behavior is
technically undefined.

It seems to take the delay slot's target if they differ and both pass.
This is the behavior the interpreter has, but it's more work in jit.

Since only a couple games seem to do this, and clearly expect this
behavior, this fixes all known cases of #1926.
