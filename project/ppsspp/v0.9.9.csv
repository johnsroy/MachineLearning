This will become really powerful if we add some code to the vertex decoder
to check for non-full alpha in the vertices, and set gstate_c.vertexFullAlpha if none
is found (probably want to do the reverse, set it to true and clear if any non-255 alpha is found).

Alpha testing is a performance killer on many mobile GPUs so big efforts to
avoid it can be worth it.

Fixes #5806, bcause it avoids rescheduling at the signal, which it should
not do.  Possibly this is incorrect for all GE signals, but we don't need
to trigger any behavior on a sync anyway.

Based on my implementation in sceAac https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/pull/5836
I've created a class AuCtx included in My SimpleAudioDec.cpp/.h which aims at providing a standard easy implementation to support all codecs in ffmpeg.
Here, I also completely re-code sceMp3 file with this class to give an example how to use this class, and it has solved all mp3 issues I've observed in the current master.
Tests on different freq and channels mp3 audios as:
Miku custom BGM (48kHz, stereo), Hanayaka Nari Wa ga Ichizoku(32kHz, mono, a little fast but better than before now), downstreet panic (44.1kHz, stereo), and learn jp09(44.1kHz, stero) are just all right.
Especially, I am very glad to see that Miku's Custom BGMs have no repetition issues in first tone any more and no longer stopped in the first second neither. :)
We will come into a new age to fast support new audio formats from now on I hope :P

If only parameters change (like wrapping or clut, etc.) we don't need to
rehash the data - we know it hasn't changed.

Should reduce the distance between lazy texture hashing on and off.

This just marks all other textures as dangerous when a hashfail occurs.

Fixes FF2 from recent optimizations.  It's slower, but still much faster
than before.
