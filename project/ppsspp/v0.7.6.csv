A quick and rough skim lead me to this quick and lazy fix. In short , IEEE 754 single-precision float is not precise enough for storing every int32 value, and you need double for that ;)

BTW, should there be a default case for the switch ((op >> 21) & 0x1f) right following below or dsv could be uninitialized?

Same issue with all non western language translations. (Fonts have weird
spacing, missing letters).
I'm pretty positive this is because western fonts include non-western
letters in a weird way, it's exactly the same thing when you see the
full contents of a chinese or japanese font you will notice that there
are some weirdly shaped (they don't follow the artistic style of the
actual font) latin letters that indeed seem to have that extra space
around them compared to the actual native font you use. Feel free to
merge it if and when you believe it's worth it (bug and quality wise).
