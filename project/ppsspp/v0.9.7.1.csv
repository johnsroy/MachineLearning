We call it in a few places to 'ensure' shutdown, e.g. before resetting,
but there are cases of double-shutdown.  Let's allow it since there's
there shouldn't be any multithreading here.

This may even be more near active memory anyway, but it reduces the '64
bit address out of range' RIP issues a bit too.  It's currently impossible
to enable appverif memory checks and jit in 64-bit...

Avoided the 32-bit path because I'm less sure about alignment.
