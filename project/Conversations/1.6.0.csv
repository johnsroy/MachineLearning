XmppAxolotlMessage is now entirely responsible for handling encryption
and decryption of messages, only leveraging XmppAxolotlSession as a
packing/unpacking primitive for payload keys.

Removed pseudo-dead session generation code step from prepareMessage
function, as sessions have been created by invoking the
TrustKeysActivity for a while now.

Added prepareKeyTransportMessage function, which creates a message with
no payload. The key that is packed into the header keyElements can then
be used for other purposes (e.g. encrypted file transfer).
