Migration 17 depends on Account deserialization, so any migrations that
touch the accounts table need to be applied beforehand.

Re-writing the migration to work directly on the database would lead to
a lot of code duplication, so it's not worth it at this time, but might
become necessary later on to avoid dependency cycles.
