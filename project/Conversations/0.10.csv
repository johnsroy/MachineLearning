"3ada834839d414e67903a5c1644ab6bdfede0c64","2014-12-24 20:35:08+00:00","Show server info option when blocking is unavailable

Current head of development branch doesn't show server information if
blocking is disabled. This is due to slightly wrong logic on an if
statement. This patch ensures only the blocking option is disabled when
blocking is not supported by the server, and that the feature remains
available.
