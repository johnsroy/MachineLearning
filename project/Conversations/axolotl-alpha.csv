Bundles are now fetched on demand when a session needs to be
established. This should lessen the chance of changes to the bundles
occuring before they're used, as well as lessen the load of fetching
bundles.

Also, the message encryption is now done in a background thread, as this
can be somewhat costly if many sessions are present. This is probably
not going to be an issue in real use, but it's good practice anyway.

We now track preKeys used to establish incoming sessions with us. On

have to do this because libaxolotl-java internally clears the used
preKey from its storage, so we will not be able to establish any future
sessions using that key.

The trust-on-first-use policy leads to problems when receiving messages
from two different devices of a contact before sending a message to them
(as their IdentityKeys will not have been added yet). Since session
trust will be managed externally anyway, this change is not a security
problem, and will allow us to decrypt messages from yet-untrusted
sessions.
