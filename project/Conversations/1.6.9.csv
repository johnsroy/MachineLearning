If we detect our own ID is not in our own devicelist on receiving an
update, we reannounce ourselves. This used to have the side effect of
modifying the list of devices we thought were in the update set, causing
us to accidentally build a session with ourselves.

This lead to our own key being set to TRUSTED_INACTIVE, resulting in red
lock icons on messages sent by the own device.

We fix this by having publishOwnDeviceId() operate on a copy of the
original set. This commit also includes a db migration which deletes
sessions with oneself and sets own keys back to TRUSTED.

There is no need to preemptively add the keys to the store oneself.
SessionBuilder will take care of this for us. What's more, this will
prevent IdentityKeys from otherwise invalid bundles to show up in our
UI.

Doesn't access database directly anymore but goes through AxolotlService
now to obtain list of fingerprints associated with an Account/Contact.
This should prevent orphaned keys littering the UI which previously
couldn't be removed through the Clear Devices function.

Together with 1c79982da84964c1d81179a0927d9cd1eadf53de this fixes #1393
