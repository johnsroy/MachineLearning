According to the Google Play crash reports, sometimes inputView
is NULL when this method is called. I should probably figure out
what causes this, but in the meantime just catching Exception
will prevent the crash at least.

The deal is that the 'normal' key used in this theme
is actually semi-transparent. So I took the dark non-
transparent shift key from the theme and replaced the
dark part with a 25% opacity white.

It doesn't quite match up, though. Unfortunately GIMP
is not great at dealing with partially transparent
individual colors, so I'll have to find some other
tool to figure out exactly what shade that is meant
to be.

Or maybe just copy the signal light onto the 'normal'
key images?

Hm... or maybe I don't need a signal light at all?

This will make it display using Medium text
if there's at least 480dp available. And
small text (the default) if there is not.

Still not actually small enough to avoid
it getting cut-off in landscape...

Probably the longer solution is to switch
to scrolling. Or maybe split it into three
screens.

Right now the launcher just takes you directly
to the settings page. I'll probably instead need
to make it take you to a 'main' activity that
can tell you whether the keyboard is enabled or not.

Now that the preferences are in a fragment, perhaps
the 'Main' activity could have the 'active or not'
button, and also show the keyboard's preferences.
