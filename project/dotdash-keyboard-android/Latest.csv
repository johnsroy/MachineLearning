I forgot that Messages are not the best way to handle
a simple delay like this, because they aren't guaranteed
to happen at a specific time. For this purpose, all I really
need is the ability to keep the key from working until
a specified time.

There may be a more performant way of achieving this, though...

Turns out my multi-touch doesn't properly
detect when you're holding down two keys
simultaneously. So, this doesn't work
very well. :-\

If you're in mode B and you quickly slip down to the space bar,
iambic mode will still automatically send its next signal. Need
to prevent that from happening by cancelling the mode B timer
if you hit space or delete.
