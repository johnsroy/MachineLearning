To run tests, `cd tests; ant run-tests`. Make sure an emulator or device is running, as the tests are run live. See Android Dev Guide's 'Testing in Other IDEs' page. All of the files in the test folder (except WebsiteScraperTests.java) were created by running `android create test-project ...`

I created a scraper interface with separate methods for each bit of parsing to be done. This will allow other scrapers to be written interchangably, and allow users to pick and choose which bits of info they want parsed (to save time, in the end).
I asked git to stop tracking binaries because there's no sense in tracking the files you're going to be building fresh anyway.
The same simple tests used for WebsiteScraper were 'ported' to ReferenceScraper.

Biggest change to original code: MinutesChecker is now called by `startActivityForResult`. This allows the code to return to _whichever_ activity called it (rather than hard-coded to ViewMinutes Activity). Necessary to reuse the login view/logic for the service. See `ViewMinutes.onActivityResult`.
Minor changes: moved some common logic into their own methods in the ViewMinutes class. See `showErrorMessageAndRequery`, `gatherAndDisplay`, and `setLoginInfo`.
New Service: Runs in the background and is automatically started the first time a phone call is received. It (currently) scrapes minute usage and displays a toast message on top of the call screen. This is slow over 3G, so I started down the path of using a persistent cache. I need to hook it up to update on GUI usage and to CALL_STATE_IDLE events.

I wouldn't call this commit stable.

"201f244cb91c7075329a8a307096cecdbc46bb8d","2011-02-17 15:00:56-08:00","cached-minutes displays on incoming call, updates on call finished. Fails semi-gracefully (annoyingly?)

On incoming call, the cache is queried for minutes data. If some is stored, that most recent cache data is displayed over the incoming message dialog (via Toast, default 10 seconds).
If cache data is not available, 2 things happen: 1) the message 'Minutes Used: Unknown' is shown, and 2) when the call ends, the user is prompted to login to VM (via the original GUI), which will update the cache for them.

This could use a few configuration options, and some string resources instead of hardcoded strings. Configuration ideas:

- whether to show minutes toast on incoming phone call?
- whether to cache minutes on call ended? (showing min on incoming phone calls may be a little useless without this ... lump together, maybe?)

Potential bug: how quickly is VM's website updated? Should we wait 5+ minutes before caching?
