1) The MAC address has to be added manually for now (Settings -> Debug)
2) Configure other notifications as desired
3) After doing that, restart Gadgetbridge, after that, the device should
be visible.
4) Tap it to connect
5) Try the Debug activity via the Menu to send some dummy notifications
=> Your MI should vibrate and blink

Also: add some extra files necessary to support Eclipse ADT. To be
migrated to Andmore, later.
