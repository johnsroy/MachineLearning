This is to pervent our service from being started when we get a notification
even if Gadgetbridge is not in use and no devices are connected.
Unfortunately we cannot enable/disable NotificationListener at runtime like we
do with broadcast receivers because it seems to invalidate the permissions that
are neccessery for NotificationListenerService
