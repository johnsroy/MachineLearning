The reason is that multiple data sets will always be grouped.
If we add null values to fix the grouping issue, we will still have
space between the bars.

- use just one data set, because multiple data sets is not supported
by MPAndroidChart (the way we need it)

Now there is hardly any space between the bars anymore

Also:
- allow scaling x and y axis independently via pinch gesture
- set fixed y max value (1.0) so that the display is stable and
independent of the actual available data
- (at least temporarily) display y labels

on the UUID_CHARACTERISTIC_BATTERY characteristic.

This is a first try at addressing #71

Please note that this will probably not work at this point, but it's
worth a try. To make it work probably we have to tell the device to
send updates, and we don't know how to do it.

- give light sleep a minimum value, because it's sometimes 0 for Mi Band

When enabled it forces to use 3.x notifications on FW 3.x (2.x notifcations on FW 2.x)
When disabled 2.x notification on FW 2.x and 1.x notifications on FW 2.x are used (which is recommended)

This allows Pebble Time users to do further tests.
