- listen to notifications early -- the band then actually tells us that
authentication is required
- check for this after sending user info
- add authentication states to GBDevice
- workaround for event problems in pairing activity (delivered although
already unregistered)
- BtLEQueue now deals with gatt events coming *before* connectGatt()
actually returned (namely the connection event)

Sometimes reconnection lead only to 'Connected' state, but not 'Initialized'.
This probably happened when the device got disconnected earlier and then was
automatically reconnected. The reconnection closed the previous connection,
which caused the dispatch-thread to wake up and think the connection is
actually establish. Then, when the first action is invoked, it would fail
with an NPE because mBluetoothGatt passed to the action is actually null.
