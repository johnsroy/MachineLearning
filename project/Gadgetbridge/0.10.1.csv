This commit contains the infrastructure needed for the
NotificationHandler to send music state information to the device. That
is, it introduces a call onSetMusicState(MusicStateSpec stateSpec), that
in turn sets up an intent to the service, which will then call the
encodeSetMusicState() function of the device. encodeSetMusicState is
available for pebble only. There are empty stubs for other devices.

Since Android 5.0, media players can have interactive notifications that
reside in the notification area, and offer up to 5 control buttons
(play/pause, next, previous, etc), and information about the currentlu
playing media file.

We use these notifications to get information about the currently
playing media file such as:
- artist
- track (title)
- album
- duration (length of the media file)
- play state (playing, paused, stopped)
- position
- play rate (how fast is the media file being played)

We then send this information up to the device.

On Pebble, the music app will display the title and the artist, as
well as a progress bar showing the current position. The progress bar is
animated when the media file is being played, and if it is being paused,
it displays a pause symbol.

This code will be skipped when GadgetBridge is run on a device with
Android version older than 5.0 (lollipop).
