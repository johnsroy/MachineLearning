- Untested features have to be turned on.
- We will accept data from any source.
- One way, we do not send out replies.

This already works with the minimalistic sports demo from the sdk

This tries to control the last player that played a (new) song.
It is very limited since we cannot get the source of an intent.
Instead we try to guess from the Action.
The problem is that we cannot support players that use only the action 'com.android.music.XXXX' and not something own.
Also try to blindly support getting spotify metadata (for testing #112)
