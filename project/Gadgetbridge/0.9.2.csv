(while performing the same, known to be working firmware update for Mi1A)

Result: double firmware update procedure works on Mi1A.

Also updated FirmwareTest. Perform all tests not only in the test itself,
but also at runtime before doing the actual update.

Further:
- fix setting of firmwareInfoSent state variable, which prevented installation
of the section firmware
- make one string translatable
