The code basically works, but there a lot of things to fix / improve.
* The alarms are stored to and read from the Shared Preferences, but there is no persistence within the app (basically they are read and stored at every access)
* The alarm list is not updated when coming back from the alarm detail view (probably related to the point above), but the actual alarm is
* The alarms preference names is sometimes built by concatenating strings, which is not really safe
* There is no check in the alarm constructor whether the stored string is a valid alarm representation
* Even though only 3 alarms can be stored on the device, we could have more in the app and let the user choose which to sync
* In the alarm detail view XML some material* drawables are used, it's possible that these break on android version < 5
* ...

- the day of week are evenly spread across the screen in the alarms detail activity
- the alarms are stored in a single shared preference (as a set) NB: you'll have to reset your alarms if you used a previous version (and also manually clean the shared preferences, but this is not needed)
- the list of alarms gets correctly updated after editing a specific alarm
- the actionbar back button saves the alarm status, the device back button doesn't. I'm not sure if it's a bug or a feature :)
