- Implement the PebbleProtocol side (2.x and 3.x)
- Add Preferences for canned replies

This can be tested by enabling untested features in Pebble Settings
It lets you see and select the replies set up in 'Canned Repies' on the Pebble
You will get a 'NOT IMPLENTED' message on your Pebble.

THIS DOES NOT ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING USEFUL YET.
