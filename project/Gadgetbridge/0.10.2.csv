- localstorage is now cleared at every launch: this prevents some clay configuration pages to send back to the watch a number of keys that were set by other configuration pages
- only execute JS on document ready: this prevents some race conditions
- added dummy getTimelineToken function to Pebble JS object
- corrected (hopefully!) a few logic errors in the JS code (this referenced where it wasn't)
- refactored the steps visualization in JS
- lifecycle changes to the java activity: now the configuration page gets closed as soon as the settings have been sent, and there is only one instance of it
