NOTES:
- YOU SHOULD NOT TRY THIS YET ;)
- This was only tested with the unoffical japansese language pack
- Problably needs proper crc calculation (I just hardcoded the one for the japanese language pack)

It should fix installation of all .pbl files (tested with Spanish, German, French and the inofficial Japanese language pack)
This also marks the return of the infamous STM32CRC, this time with hopefully fixed tail code.
