The primary external dir is often a user-partition on the internal
storage medium. This one is safe in multi-user environments.

The 'removable storage' (sdcard) on the other hand can be read by
everyone. If the former is not available or not writable, use the
latter.

The reason being that we filter samples by activity kind
and then calculate the total sleep time using a delta between two
consecutive sample timestamps. But due to filtering of samples, not
all samples are consecutive. Instead of we have 'holes' and add those
to your sleep time.

The data in the db is correct though (it always is), it's just the
display in the app that is wrong.
