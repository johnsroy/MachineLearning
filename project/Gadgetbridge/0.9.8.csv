This will result in duplicate entries (first the whole cache, then actually installed watchfaces)
It might already make watchface configuation working on 2.x even though it is dirty

I wish everybody would just update to 3.x *sigh*

This message was previously treated as a further 'Sleep' message type, with firmware version 3.12 further types were added that are clearly unrelated to sleep (possibly to high-intensity activities like running etc.), hence the related code is now moved to a separate class.

The only decoded records are still sleep-related.
