thread-safe: (1) wrong dates were parsed for 'today', leading to wrong
unwatched aired counts, and (2) wrong/broken up next episode strings in
seasons list); Reverted # of episodes aired to count that doesn't
include today; Small improvements; Made seasons list layout more
consistent with shows list: next episode is now grayed out/normal
instead of normal/bold; optimized getView() for all lists; Now using
Calendar instances instead of using deprecated Date methods.

6.7; Performance issue: legacy code for episode list used to do a
database query per episode on every getView(), now it uses one query for
the entire list; Moved createTVShowItem to SQLiteStore; Fixed
IntentReceiverLeaked problems in show/episode view when swipe back
gesture was used while finger on rating/names.
