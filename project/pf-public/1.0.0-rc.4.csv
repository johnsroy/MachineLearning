Java sources for PFDock. I pruned the sources from my private repo
because there's some files in there that I can't open-source due to
them not being licensable. There's also some very embarrassing code
in there. Including sources to web site, based on Paul Irish's HTML5
boilerplate. (http://html5boilerplate.com/)
