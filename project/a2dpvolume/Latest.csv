and I fixed it there by using the compareignoringcase() function.  However, I was comparing a BluetoothDevice to another.  Here I need to get a btDevice from the database.

* Adeed last location data exporter.  Exports a text file to the BlusetoothVol directory on the SD card.  This is in the Manage Data screen.
* Several improvements to the way the service starts and stops, and reports status.  The service now starts be default when you open the application.  If you make preference changes, the service will reinitialize to load the new preferences.
* GUI changes to make it a bit more intuitive and have a better layout.  Too many people did not understand what 'Location' meant.
