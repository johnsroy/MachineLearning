- Replacing 'px' and 'sp' units with 'dp' for paddings (sp is intented for font sizes)
- Adjusting padding for more clean look
- slightly reduce chat font size
- Remove italic font for sans font. Droid Sans has no italic font face but instead
just slants the font which looks hideous (sorry ;-))

New logos based on the new SVG logo. Intention was not only
to provide HDPI resources but also to have a decent look
on Froyo and Gingerbread devices (black menu background) as well
as follow the icon design guidelines, at least with respect to
the icon dimensions.
