* huge:  30 dp

Also, the date and nickname are now scaled to 67% of the chat text.

This reverts commit 436c6bb318702b1b5078ad0399f19280408d3d90.

Client priority is an internal feature of XMPP that is not really
relevant to IM. It is sufficient to keep it well hidden in the
Account Preferences screen, in case a power user needs it.
