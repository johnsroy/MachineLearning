this reverts an old change where a new SmackableImp was created
for each (re)connection, making XEP-0198 impossible in the process.

Now, a cleaner API is introduced, with the aim to allow multiple
SmackableImp instances for different servers to run in parallel.

This will report the (translated) app_name string, the long version

The latter is a violation of XEP-0092 security considerations, however
yaxim is only available on Android, and you can already identify yaxim
based on a `disco#info` query.

Maybe there will be a configuration option to disable that behavior one
day.

This changes the Activity stack of Android to only ever allow one
instance of MainWindow in the stack. This should help in situations
where you press 'Quit' and the app or a chat window is still there.

WARNING! HORRIBLE SIDE-EFFECTS AHEAD!

This change prevents the message state to go ACKED -> FAILED. This is
due to the fact that XEP-0184 ACKs always beat error stanzas (once the
message was delivered, you can't undeliver it!).

This is needed because prosody does not request 0198 ACKs per message,
but instead does bulk requests from time to time. Therefore it is
possible that prosody thinks the messages were not delivered, even
though they were XEP-0184-acked already.

Androiders forgot to implement:

Because they added them with Gingerbread, the compiler won't warn you,
and the app crashes in evil ways on SDK<r9 devices. Thank you so much,
Google!
