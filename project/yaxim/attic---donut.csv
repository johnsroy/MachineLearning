Scenario: open ChatWindow, but moved to the background, by launcher or
other app. Incoming msg creates notification. Opening notification
creates a new ChatWindow on top of the existing one, creating a stack
of multiple ChatWindow activities.

The included patch removes the old ChatWindow activity in favor for the
one opened by the notification.

To recover from send failures in smack's PacketWriter which would
normally cause the send message to be silently lossed, we now get noticed
and can queue the message for resending later.

For this, we need a special PacketListener in smack that notifies yaxim
that a message could not be sent. This is introduced in
https://github.com/tuxmobil/asmack/commit/5498d4b9a701219d095f27b4f79c17d9ac8c94b6.

For yaxim, the chat message DB was extended to store smack's packet ID for
each message so that messages can be identified when they could not be
sent. The already available mechanism for offline sending is then used to mark
them for later resending.
