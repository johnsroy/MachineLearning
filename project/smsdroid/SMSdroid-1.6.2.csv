If the receive intent gets more than one PDU passed only the first one was
handled, causing long SMS messages on Kitkat to get truncated after 160
characters. Concatenate the body of all received PDUs before handling the
content to avoid this.

Fixes issue #830.

Convert emoticons in message text when showing, and make sure NCR convertion is
done first. Otherwise enabled NCR conversion causes already converted emoticons
to be lost. Fixes issue #644.

Note that an already displayed message list doesn't get updated when changing
options, so changing conversion settings won't be visible until the app is
restarted.

When composing a new message the EditText had TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_SHORT_MESSAGE
unset while it was set when replying to an existing message. The flag usually
results in the keyboard replacing Enter with a Smiley button.

Since some people obviously like having Enter when composing SMS add an option
to change the state of TYPE_TEXT_VARIATION_SHORT_MESSAGE for those EditText
elements.

Addresses issue #646.
