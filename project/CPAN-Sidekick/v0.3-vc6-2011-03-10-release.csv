No feature changes. This just puts the content of the module search and module
viewer into a fragment so we can have a special tablet view.

This adds a working version of the search activity that displayes the search
results on the left and the select item on the right. It does not look right as
the header for the view blends with the ActionBar and the search should be moved
into the action bar.

To be done:

* Separate the header into a floating box, distinct from the ActionBar
* Show the search in the action bar instead of the search sidebar
* Keep items selected in the search results when displaying in the view
* Add a triangle/arrow drawable to show which item is selected, similar to how
the Android design guidelines demonstrate
* Show a blank box telling the user to search for something when there are no
results.
* Automatically select the first result when search returns something

The problem was that each Gravatar icon was being fetched in a separate thread.
Since no test of mine had caused more than 10 tasks to be loaded at once, this
was not a problem. However, the tablet sized screen made more than 10 rows
loading at once common, so this exception was starting to happen with some
frequency. Fixed by loading all the Gravatar icons for each search in one go.

This moves the search out of the module search fragment and makes it part of the
activity itself. This also makes it so that the module search activity is better
integrated with Android's built-in search features, though I am not using the
built-in search dialog at this point because I want the search EditText to stay
up all the time.

This change adds the search menu to the ActionBar for Honeycomb, but does not
implement it yet, so search is now broken on Honeycomb.

Nesting the module info fragment seemed like a good idea, but it caused massive trauma, so I made it a layout include instead.

I also had trouble with swapping the help/placeholder fragment with the POD view. Apparently, Android really hates it if you code that in as a literal XML resource and then change it programmatically. It is much happier if you just stick to either keeping it permanent via XML or setting it up and swapping it programmatically. At least, that seems to be easier. If there's some magic incantation to make it work, I couldn't find it and my friends over on StackOverflow recommended against it.
