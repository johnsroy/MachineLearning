Basic functionality implemented for logout. Added menu item and basic
activity that removes database and clears stored username and password.
Still needed is a confirmation dialog at the very least.

Changed the value of DATABASE_NAME from private to protected so we can
get read-only external access to it from other classes. This will avoid
having to hard-code the database name in the delete call for logging
out.

Move the logout process from the Logout activity to Home. Also,
implement the Logout confirmation AlertDialog.

This closes #35

Since Android does not automatically cleanup our
data directory, added a simple recursive delete on
the image cache when a logout is performed, cleaning
up any mess we may have left. Additionally, updated
the logout confirmation to string to reflect that it
will delete images as well.

The logout dialog was launching a new instance of the home
activity every time it was dismissed by touching outside the
dialog instead of through the proper Cancel button. This
commit is just a quick fix to fix that.

After launching the Login activity (firstRunInit), call finish() to
close the old activity. This prevents a NPE if the user goes 'back' when
the login activity is displayed.

Fixes #42

I've come to realize I don't actually like the cards
scrolling over the top the picture. Changed to a normal

and Status on top of each other for landscape because
it looks nicer that way & less scrolling.
