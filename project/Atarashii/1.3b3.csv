This commit adds croutons that appear in the main UI
to alert the user that we will be going into or leaving
offline mode. The checks happen onResume() and also
on the 'CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE' broadcast in order to cover
all possible scenarios when connectivity loss could arise.

In addition, this commit also disables the option to sync
while offline by checking a flag that is set by the
connectivity check. Todo is make everything work offline.

This commit persists the connection flag through
orientation changes.

Also fixed a derp in the manifest.

Basically, if network connectivity changed outside the
app, the BroadcastReceiver was still registered and
was still listening for events, resulting in a potentially
long queue of croutons when the app was opened.

This commit changes the behaviour such that the receiver
is only listening while in the Home activity, and
unregistered on leaving. This completes the desired
behaviour of only seeing the Croutons when a state change
occurs, or when entering the Home screen via the check
onResume().

Added a setting to display volumes on the covers for
manga instead of anime. Due to implementation though, I
had to touch a ton of places. Mostly just adding a 'false'
to the calls to getPersonalProgress() since that will
return the exact same value as before this commit.

As a result, the launch looks even nicer.

TODO is look into adding a fade animation instead of
just popping the image in place of the transparency.
Would look incredibly pretty. Not high priority though.

Low Priority == I felt like doing it right now.

This commit adds a lovely fade in animation to the covers
whenever we need to load them in, be it from the network
or decoding them from file. This also contributes to how
nice the app looks on launch. There is no longer any
jarring elements to induce eye-cancer on startup :)

Added apkawa to the major contributor section inside the application
as they implemented search.

This commit adds offline mode functionality. Basically,
if we don't have network in DetailView, don't try to load
from the network, just use what we have. Similarily,
don't try to sync to MAL with no connection, just save
locally.

When connection is restored (detected by the Home activity),
first we write any records marked dirty to MAL, then sync
as usual.

Also, the Search and Sync options vanish with no connection
and return when connection returns.

Oh, and I converted all the Toasts to Croutons. They look
much nicer now.

ImageDownloader now checks to see if the network is
available before attempting to download the image,
because we'd simply be wasting time and effort trying
to download without a network.

Make cover actions work while offline. Incidentally,
they had actually never been marking a record dirty.
Never caused an issue before, just thought it was
interesting.

Out of the blue, Eclipse has deciced to have a seizure
and realize that Crouton is actually an issue when it
rightfully should be. The reason for this error is because
we are providing an extremely old version of the support
library from ABS. Crouton was using a constant that had
yet to exist, so now we have to bring our own library.

Also updated BUILDING to reflect the new steps.
