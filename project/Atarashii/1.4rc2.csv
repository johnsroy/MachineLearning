When selecting an item that leads to an activity (Profile, Friends), that item was being highlighted. However, once returned from the activity the item would still be selected even thoughwrong. This commit solves the issue by not highlighting items that lead to activities at all.

Until we can re-do the layout, this fix should handle overflow issues on
long URLs. First, strip the leading 'http' from them and then limit the
length to 20 characters. This won't affect the actual click location,
just the display.
