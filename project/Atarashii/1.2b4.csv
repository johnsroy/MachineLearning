The project now uses ActionBarSherlock classes in order to support all
the way back to Android 2.2. This commit sees the beginning of the
conversion with First Run, Home, and ItemGridFragment converted.
There's also a nasty bug where you can't log in yet because of some
crazy error.

Also, because ABS is a separate Android project acting a library, to use
this repo now you have to get it working in your local IDE (or compiler)
manually.

It was causing a horribly VerifyError since NOMTExc didn't exist back in
API level 8 (2.2). We shouldn't need it anyways, since our net code is
always called from a separate thread.

Since .addall() wasn't introduced until API 11, I added a simple
supportAddAll method that simply runs a foreach loop and hands each
record to .add(), which is available. Works, solves that crash.

Added alternative way of getting byte size since older platforms didn't
support the all-in-one getByteCount.

the screen size isn't calculated right atm

Android pre-ICS by default has fading edges enabled. Added the attribute

add the backport.

Plenty of changes to make this happen. Most noteworthy, the project now
requires SimonVT's NumberPicker backport in order to compile. It's to be
linked in the same way as ActionBarSherlock, so unfortunately it can't
be included in the repo and has to be setup manually.

Made it work, though the layout refuses to cooperate on Android 2.2, and
insists on pushing the ':' in 'Chapters:' to a second line, mucking up
the alignment. I've tried everything and absolutely can't get this to
work, so it'll just have to be left as is for now.

If set to true, it displays a right facing caret (>) on the card,
indicating it is touchable. Cards that have this set should also have a
clicklistener set on them, so it does actually do something. Also added

'My Score' and 'MAL Score' and now part of the info card. As part of
this, since the MAL Score was never downloaded before I updated the
relevant methods to fetch the information if it doesn't exist on the

GenericMALRecord to return 'Not Rated Yet' if the entry is 0 - not
rated.

Now, we calculate and auto-adjust the height of the grid cells to match
our desired 0.7 aspect ratio. This should allow most cover images to
properly scale without much cropping being done. Some longer or wider
images will still be cropped, but there isn't much that can be done
about that.

Note that this is fairly rough. It can probably be refined a bit more.

the score and created a getFormattedScore() method for handling what it
