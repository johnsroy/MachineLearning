Perhaps bridge wasn't the correct term, but after merging a number
of commits, either lists worked (api..) or friends and profile worked
(newapi..). As far as I'm aware, the new API Michael is working on
(I think?) isn't completed, so I made a temporary overflow method
to use the different endpoint and everything works happily now.

The methods are commented so once everything works these changes
should be easily reverted.

Also Git decided to replace a couple lines it needed to replace
nearly the whole file. Weird. But expected.
