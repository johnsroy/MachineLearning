The commits that added search used methods only available
in JRE1.7 (Java 7), this commit fixes them to be JRE1.6 compliant.

In fact, I'm not even sure how Apkawa got it to compile, as
it refused to compile on my end, and Android shouldn't even be
able to run JRE1.7 code, as Dalvik is based on JRE1.6.

TODO is a fix a method introduces in MALManager that uses an API only
available at level 11 or higher. I've added a version check for the
call, and currently returning null on version prior to 11. While this
is breaking functionality for pre-3.0 devices, it does allow the
code to compile. A suitable replacement should be added in the method
to ensure Froyo and Gingerbread users can use the app.

Added the UI flow for adding an item to list. Basically,
we check if the record's watch status is null, which is
only a possibility if it isn't on a list, then set the
action bar to contain an add button, and hide extraneous
elements (like score, progress) as they don't matter
when it isn't on a list.

I've also added a method in this commit to revert the UI
changes after a record is added, but this is obviously not
functioning at the moment due to the add button not doing
anything :)

This was a long time coming, but as of this commit, after
searching for an anime or manga, you can simply hit the +
to add it to your list. The current behaviour defaults
to 'watching' or 'reading', though I may make this
customizable. Or if we can learn start date, have it
'planned' before the start date and 'watching' after.
I dunno, just pitching ideas.

As records that were searched for and loading in a
detail view are stored in the database, the everything list
includes these entries that were not added. As a fix, I've
updated the database searching to search for any of
the statuses that something on a list can be, therefore
they no longer appear.

As best as I can figure out, there is some kind of threading issue in
Android 3.0 and below where the typeMap somehow gets used for both
manga and anime records, making values not match properly. This leads
to null values in areas that shouldn't have them. This is fixed by
always building the typeMap when getTypeMap is called.

Fixes #51

This commit serves to make the app launch as seamless
as possible. Previously, the background that was drawn
when the app launched wasn't drawn immediately because it
was part of the layout, not the window. This commit moves
the background to be part of the app's style, thus no more
jarring white -> gray transition.

As a result, I've also eliminated an entire layer of
overdraw throughout the app, so devices with lower-end
GPUs should have an easier time rendering the layouts.
