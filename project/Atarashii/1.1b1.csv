I updated CoverAdapter to cast to GenericMALRecord, as well as adding an
abstract method getAmountConsumed() to GenericMALRecord, which is to be
implemented by AnimeRecord and MangaRecord to return a 'consumed'
amount, in the case of AnimeRecord, the watched count. AnimeRecord's
implementation is already handled, and everything should continue to
build and run fine without errors.

All this work does the best possible to make functions generic where they

I merged in the Cover Actions code from the working branch so that manga
support can hopefully avoid any conflicts, since the Cover Actions did
require me to manually merge once because there was some modifications
in some of the files that are also used in manga support (ie.
CoverAdapter). Since Cover Actions are done, merging this in felt like a
smart idea in order to prevent conflicts. Also I updated the .gitignore
with the .settings folder for my Eclipse.
