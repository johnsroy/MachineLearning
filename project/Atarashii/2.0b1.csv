Some small fixes to allow Gradle to work. Google released v20 and 21 of
the support library, and as we were not forcing a specific version, it
was choosing the newest. This caused issues with Crouton and also SDK
versioning. Force support library 19 to avoid the error. Additionally,
update the version of Crouton to pull in some bug fixes from it.

The callback functions always contain the same logic for Anime and
Manga, so they can be unified in on function. This removes some
duplicated code and avoids repetitions if something needs to be changed
in the callbacks.
So now there is only one callback for Anime/MangaNetworkTask:
onNetworkTaskFinished, without type separation. To determine the list
type the function has the additional ListType parameter 'type'.

Instead let them finish but don't display results (thats why there is

low minimum API level. It can be simplified as soon as we drop < API 11.

After deleting the database (on logout), no new one was created because
the MALSqlHelper was not recreated for two reasons:
- the MALSqlHelper is designed as singleton (object is retrieved by

database
- malSqlHelper was defined as static in DatabaseManager, so even fixing
the first point would not fix the bug, because all instances of
DatabaseManager share the same malSqlHelper

Now MALSqlHelper has the new function deleteDatabase() that deletes the
database and sets instance to null so the next call to getHelper() will
recreate the database. Also malSqlHelper is not defined as static in
DatabaseManager. Also cancel running NetworkTasks on logout to make sure

As now all records are accessed by relations (anime-/mangalist or record
relations like prequels, adaptations etc.) all records in the database
that are not related somehow are 'dead' records. So I implemented some
functions to delete them:
- deleteFrom(Anime/Manga)List() now checks if the deleted record is
still related to other records and deletes it if not
- a full sync now also checks for unrelated records and deletes them
