On grid covers, the status string was aligned to the baseline of the
item count. This caused a different alignment for statuses where the
count was hidden. It was especially noticible for views which mixed
statuses. Adding padding to the bottom of the status string now keeps
alignment the same.

This check was for pre-rewrite versions of the application. It forced a
sync against the website. Unfortunately, it causes duplicate sync
processes on new installs. Possibly, it also contributes to a NPE on
Android 3.x devices. (See issue #40)

In some cases on Android 3.x, mManager is null for the record tasks.
This will attempt to re-create the object if this is the case.
