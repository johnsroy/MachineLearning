Someone left a review on Play stating that he hit
the previous limit of 999 chapters in a manga. Truthfully,
I had no idea there was manga that ran longer than a
thousand chapters and still didn't have a defined end.

Limit bumped up to 9999. Considering the longest running
manga is now at about 1700 chapters, I think this should
be fine.

After discussing it with Motoko, it occurs to me that
9999 was just too high. Adjusted to a nicer value. Also
an easter egg.

I also fixed an apparantly long-withstanding bug in that
the volume counter would not update visually when it was
changed. Neat.

Removing from our database (and our list) would require
much more work than any other action would in regards to
offline sync and can't be handled by our current implemention.

So for now, I'm simply disabling the option if network isn't
available. Quick fix, but it shouldn't really be an issue.

Prevented crashes if the API has issues on searching.

Also changed search to now search both anime AND manga at the
same time. In addition, if there is no results for either a
crouton is displayed. If there is only results for one, the
pager autoselects the one with results and slides to it.

Also, keyboard is hidden after subsequent searches within the
SearchActivity, and the SearchView is collapsed upon returning
to the main activity. This is optimal behaviour and will make
people (me) happy.

Context isn't passed to our background tasks in Android versions below 4. Change the calls to getRecords to explicitly always pass context to the method and then pass context to the methods it calls. We can then safely create MALManager if it's null (Android below 4) without an NPE when on our first login.

We can use Android's resource system to handle #57, so I created

and we'll be set.
