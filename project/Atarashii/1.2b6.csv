Aparently, certain features, like renaming the package (for beta
releases), don't work well when you have Android projects inside each
other, as had been done with the third-party submodule directory. This
change moves all the Atarashii code to its own self-contained directory.

Additionally, update the BUILDING document to reflect the layout change.

Was accidentally trying to call setDirty on mAr, which
doesn't exist when dealing with manga. Changed to mMr.

Avoiding the use of global variables as index pointers, this avoids
having multiple calls trampling all over each other. It also makes for
cleaner queries and, hopefully, easier future maintenance.

Removing the textColor attribute properly sets all the colors in the
dialog. This was tested to work on AOSP and HTC Sense.

This first commit for this feature adds all of UI and
workflow to make this work. The remove action will never
be shown in the action bar, and thus must be invoked on
purpose. In addition, a confirmation dialog will appear
asking the user to confirm their choice, as the action is
destructive. Currently non-functional, 2/2 will make it work.

Added a method to delete from out database, updated
the relevant methods and records to delete from MAL when
removal is confirmed. Tested working 100%.
