The score values should be treated as numbers, not strings. Better typing
should help prevent exception errors. Now, the MAL Member Score is a
float and the user's score is an integer.

Also, since there is now a dedicated 'card' for scores, this commit also
removes the display of the member score from the general info card.

For pre-3.0 devices, the popup menu uses icons. This adds platform-styled

Added the logic to set rating after the score has been downloaded.
Also, added ignore = dirty to .gitmodules to work around an issue with
newer submodules and newer versions of Git.

This commit adds a permissions,
'net.somethingdreadful.MAL.permissions.UPDATE_MEDIA', that 3rd party
apps must request in order to use Atarashii to update MyAnimeList
through Atarashii. Also a permission group, .USE_ATARASHII for
.UPDATE_MEDIA and any future permissions we might add for services we
extend to third parties.

Also: In handling support this way, we can attract users by having only
one app handle their MAL account, as well as creating a
developer-friendly way to easily integrate MAL - through Atarashii!.

More prep for managing items deleted through the website/other clients.

These changes now set things up so the 'lastUpdate' value is updated
every time the record is synced from the website. The next step will be
to detect records that were not updated, thus deleted from the website,
and purge them from our database.

Additionally, updated getMangaRecordsFromDB to function more like
getAnimeRecordsFromDB so it will be more readable.

This brings us some progress on #19.

Additionally, I spent way too long making this work, but I
extended RatingBar to make the flavour text update as you
slide your finger across it. Looks super cool and neat.
