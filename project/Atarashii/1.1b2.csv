During commit of 149efb77ac, res/values-large/styles.xml got added. This
was being used by some devices and causing a non-ActionBar theme to be
used, which caused a crash when trying to access the action bar in the
application. This change removes the bad file and adjusts
res/values/styles.xml to use the Holo style like it should.

Commit 15a7969a introduced a fix to a crash error where whitespace at the
end of a username could cause a crash bug. This commit removes the
replace and instead uses trim on the string. It also does the same for
the password field as the user may make a similar error there as well.

I know it likely won't change anything, but I'm a bit paranoid and went
ahead and changed AppTheme to Holo.Light.DarkActionBars for all the
styles.xmls.
