We don't have a particularly good way of matching email attachments by
extension, since the URI looks something like:

content://com.android.email.attachmentprovider/2/198/RAW

Setting up the intent-filter to match mimeType */* was causing Easy Token
associations to pop up in the Contacts list.  Limiting this to text/*
and application/* is an imperfect workaround but it makes the problem go
away.

Unfortunately we will still match inappropriate email attachments.
Various MUAs will mark our SDTID files as application/octet-stream,
application/sdtid, text/html, text/xml, or who knows what else.

The former libraries are a little easier to work with because nettle
has a proper pkg-config file.  Also, libtom.org is now offline.

The fix in 0.81 shouldn't really affect Android, but let's make sure it
doesn't break it either.
