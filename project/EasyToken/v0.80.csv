When the user clicks on the tokencode widget, it (re)starts MainActivity.

duplicate copies of the activity, e.g.

Stack #1:
Task id #1088
TaskRecord{426608e8 #1088 A=app.easytoken U=0 sz=2}
Intent { flg=0x10000000 cmp=app.easytoken/.MainActivity }

it will operate as though the user clicked the Launcher icon.  This is
exactly what we want.

It was observed that on screen rotation, the frag_0/frag_1 divider
suddenly reappeared - even if we were using TokencodeFragment.  So we
will need to cache the visibility status and set it up if the activity
is ever re-created.

Commit cf2c1c3396 (Don't draw divider if only frag_0 is present)
introduced a regression that caused mTokenPresent to be set to true

The max_id preference is only updated on deletion, so it winds up stuck
at -1 after import overwrites an existing token.  To prevent this, update
the value on save too.
