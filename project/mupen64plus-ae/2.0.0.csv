Added space to name ('Mupen64Plus' too long, so 's' gets clipped or word-wrapped in apps list for most phones).  Fixed formatting on a couple lines.  Updated the version int and string in manifest.  Set changelog URL to Beta Testing thread instead of Release Candidate thread.  Dropped in latest translations from Transifex.
