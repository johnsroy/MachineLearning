Bug introduced in commit
48e94450531fe6af307737cb3606b492e188d569

which broke two methods in the core API:

- ConfigGetUserDataPath
- ConfigGetUserCachePath

These paths can only be resolved through the Android customizations
that we've been using all along.  It wasn't obvious, however, because
the only code that calls these methods are:
- Rice uses ConfigGetUserDataPath for hi-res textures & tex dumps
- Glide uses both, but only if TEXTURE_FILTER is defined (which it
currently isn't)

Note that ConfigGetUserConfigPath and ConfigGetSharedDataPath never
broke because they are obtained by the core via command-line arg and
config file, respectively.
