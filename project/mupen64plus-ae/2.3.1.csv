Notable change is that reports are deleted from user's device if couch
db rejects them.  Before, they would accumulate on device.  Rejection
can occur if the user is using an older version of mupen.

TODO:
- Use correct aspect ratio for PAL (do we even support PAL?)

This commit changes the way the video sizing is implemented. Previously
the core was given a rendering context that spanned the full extent of
screen space provided by Android's layout manager.  It was the duty of
the video plugin to define a viewport within that context to render to.
This required a significant amount of custom code to be added to the
video plugins just for the android edition.  There were also some arti-
facts with this method for Rice on some devices (i.e. junk graphics in
the margins).

Here, the alternative approach is to do the render context downsizing
on the Java side using the Android layout management APIs.  Instead of
passing a GameSurface that fills the screen, we make the GameSurface
only extend to the final desired rendering size.  The video plugins are
thus guaranteed not to draw in the pillarbox/letterbox margins, and
need not perform those sizing calculations.

The benefits are
- No customization of the video plugins required
- Simplifies integration of new video plugins
- Easier to maintain
- Easy to add new video features (resolution, hor. position, etc.)
- Fixes 'junk graphics in the margin' issues on Rice
- Adds screen position feature to glide

Before, users had to use the third-party MOGA Universal Driver app.
Great app, but requires root for full analog compatibility, and
still doesn't provide analog control for pre-Android 3.1 devices.
That left
- unrooted users*
- pre-3.1 users
without analog control.

This commit fixes that.  Now, if the user downloads the official first-
party MOGA Pivot app, they get fully-mappable analog support all the
way back to Android 2.3, no root required.  The only limitation is that
menu navigation via the controller is only supported for the MOGA Pro
in HID mode B.

* (Previously, unrooted users with Android 3.1+ and a MOGA Pro
controller had full analog support if they switched controller to HID
mode B.)
