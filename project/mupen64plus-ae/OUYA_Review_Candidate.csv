Just input-sdl renamed to input-android. As a Mupen core plugins noob,
it's easier for me to start with a working example and tear down,
rather than building the plugin from the ground up.

input-android: Removed code for loading config from Mupen API.

We are managing all input configuration using Android's scaffolding, so
we do not need to interact with Mupen's configuration file API.

input-android: Removed more stuff related to unused Mupen config API.

input-android: Tell core that all controllers are plugged.

This is just a temporary solution until the actual plugged settings can
be obtained from the front-end.  (Will require an additional JNI func.)

input-android: Removed SDL dependency completely.

This is a bare-minimum removal. A ton of unused code remains, which can
be cleaned up later.

For now, I had to break vibration and in-game pak switching, but for
the most part the plugin is completely functional as far as I can tell.
Anyhow, this is a good base to streamline from.

input-android: Removed unreachable code.

input-android: Removed unreachable __linux__ code.

input-android: Replace printf with generalized debugger calls.

input-android: Formatted code, with no other changes.

input-android: Removed #ifdef _DEBUG directives (redundant?).

input-android: Removed unused #includes.

input-android: Remove more unused code.

input-android: Consolidate some code.

input-android: More streamlining.

input-android: Code rearranged with few other changes.

input-android: Fixed debug logging and cleaned up variable names.

input-android: Remove raw data processing, and more streamlining.

input-android: Eliminated header files, removed unused function.

input-android: Deleted irrelevant doc files.

input-android: Streamlining pretty much complete.

TODO:
- Create JNI interface to communicate
- which controllers are plugged
- what pak they're using
- Verify proper operation of paks
- Verify proper swapping of paks in-game
- Implement rumble feature

input-android: Remove mercurial ignore file.

I don't foresee this ever being pushed upstream since it's so tightly
integrated with Mupen64Plus-AE.

input-android: Final simplifications, fixed debug logging.

TODO:

- which controllers are plugged

Tested on Diddy Kong racing. The pattern might need a little tuning in
the Java code, but otherwise working fine. The native code is basically
finished. The only remaining native items are to re-wire the debugger
to the extern implementation, but this should wait until the front-end
plugin has been slimmed down.

Remaining items on the Java side:
- Create UI for specifying pak type. The button mappings do not
currently work and should probably be removed. I favor using the in-
game menu to switch paks, rather than a mapped button, as this would
be much easier to implement.
- Get rumble working on peripheral devices (gamepads). This will just
require some Java code in the *Controller classes.  Presently, only
the phone vibrator is used, and only for Player 1 rumbles.
