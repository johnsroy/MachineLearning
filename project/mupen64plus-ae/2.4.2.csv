Anything we explicitly specify in NativeConfigFiles.java cannot be
overridden by manually editing the mupen64plus.cfg file.  So generally
the only things we should ever explicitly write to file are

- settings that are exposed via the main menu interface (i.e. anything
in UserPrefs.java)
- settings that should never be changed manually (i.e. anything in
AppData.java, hard-coded file paths, settings required for Android
that differ from upstream defaults)

Otherwise, we should just allow the native core/plugin code to write
the default values specified by upstream.

TODO:
- AutoStateSlotIncrement: Either expose this in the main menu, or
remove the forced setting in NativeConfigFiles.java
- Figure out the dependencies between Rice's TextureEnhancement and
TextureEnhancementControl settings
- Identify any other Rice settings that should be forced explicitly in
NativeConfigFiles.java (OpenGLRenderSetting, AnisotropicFiltering,
etc.)
- Consider removing more Rice settings from the front menu

Enabling framelimiter (the upstream default) minimizes latency with the
audio-sdl plugin. Disabling the framelimiter is only useful for bench-
marking framerate with dummy audio.

In my testing with older devices, I see no benefit to disabling frame-
limiter as a means of increasing framerate.  My guess is that this
commit won't negatively affect older devices, though it would be nice
to know for sure.

See Advanced menu.  Setting to a much smaller number seems to reduce
latency just a bit... or maybe it's just a placebo.  Labeling it
'experimental' so users are warned.

Will submit a pull request upstream to see if this is an acceptable
fix.

Regression introduced in commit
316954b07b56eb2a55d5fed31bc856ee325446aa

Forgot to port the swap_rom(.) and trim(.) functions from C to Java.
Headers for some roms are saved in a different byte order, which wasn't
being accounted for.

Also, an assortment of small fixes
- better use of try/catch/finally
- change unknown fields from ints to bytes
- name is empty rather than null on read error
