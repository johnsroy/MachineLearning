Got rid of the 'Migrate slot saves' item, it's been six months since
Trev's version was removed from the market.  At this point, better just
to handle such issues on the forum.

Also removed a few remnants of code left over after we moved the
'Controller info' item to the mapping screen menu.

Like Steam's 'Big Picture' mode.

Big-screen mode is useful for anyone running the app on a television or
monitor, not just OUYA users.  Also makes the code a little more clear,
avoiding confusion with OUYAInterface.IS_OUYA_HARDWARE, which tests
exclusively for the presence of the OUYA system.

Also consolidated the ActionBar check into a UserPrefs field for better
readability.

allow users to compensate for 'wear' in the original N64 optical en-

SDL needs to overwrite the main function to initialize the inner state on some

undefined behaviour.

Systems which need a special main function are for example Apple MacOS,
Android, iPhone or Win32. SDL will handle it automatically and keep systems
without such requirement with an untouched main function.

The implementation of the SI regiser DMA busy bit caused regressions in games
like Mischief Makers (no gamepad input is detected by the game). The only known
benefit seems to be the reduced message spam about duplicated interrupts.

The message spam caused by some ROMS can be tolerated until the cause of the
regression is better understood.

A hack and slash transplant operation.  Just pulled the FrameSkipper
class from the gles2n64 plugin, and wired it into gles2glide64.  Prefs
are passed through the gles2glide config file for now.  Eventually they
should be migrated to the official mupen config file.  (Although up-
stream hasn't migrated everything yet either, so we could just wait
until they're finished.)

I made the defaults for glide 'No more than 5 frames', whereas gles2n64
defaults to 'No more than 2 frames'.  Open to debate...

If this implementation sticks, then we should probably move the Frame-
Skipper and ticks files into the ae-bridge, since they're carbon copies
between gles2n64 and gles2glide64.
