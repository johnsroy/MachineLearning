Consolidate loading the ae-bridge/sdl/core/front-end libraries to one
place.  Simplifies maintenance.  Putting it in CoreInterfaceNative is
also a better place because it guarantees that those 4 libraries will
always be loaded before any other calls to the native methods.

Also, moving the lib loading functions to CoreInterfaceNative from
FileUtil ensures that those 4 libraries will always be loaded before
any of the plugins.

Not quite sure how to replicate this bug but I see a lot of it in the
crash reports:

java.lang.IllegalStateException: play() called on uninitialized AudioTrack.
at android.media.AudioTrack.play(AudioTrack.java:883)
at paulscode.android.mupen64plusae.CoreInterfaceNative$1.run(CoreInterfaceNative.java:356)

I think the bug is related to an existing audio track not quitting
before initializing a new one.  If I am correct, then the bug was
introduced in commit 6cfff95c269a3aad48a138d1cd5fcb81e383b4b9, where
some SDL2 example code was cut & pasted into the app overtop one of our
previous bugfixes.

To (hopefully) fix the bug, I just reverted the code to what it was
prior to commit 6cfff95c269a3aad48a138d1cd5fcb81e383b4b9 (with a few
minor changes).

The SDL2 example that this implementation drew from has a bug.
AudioTrack.release() needs to be called when shutting down the audio
thread.  The O/S creates a second native thread behind the scenes for
AudioTrack (in addition to our Audio thread we create in Java). Without
this bugfix, two things occur:
- Somehow an additional AudioTrack thread gets created and orphaned
during core startup.
- The AudioTrack thread never gets killed during core shutdown.

I'm not sure if the first effect creates any hit to performance or not.
The second side-effect is currently obscured by the ASDP bug/workaround
because the thread is eventually killed by exit(status) in ae-bridge.
Once we actually fix the ASDP bug, we will no longer call exit(..) and
the second-side effect will become apparent.
