It is impossible for me to test and the actually exported functions are not all
marked correctly. Therefore, it is better to leave the linker without knowledge
about the actually exported functions until anyone with the required hardware
were able to mark the required functions.

All non-static functions are now exported. So it should be save to switch the

I left the debug logging in, just as a guide for creating other custom
preferences in the future, since the lifecycle of a Preference is so
piss-poorly documented.  I'll remove it all on the next commit.

Dirty state is retained 'the Android way' using Parcelable objects.
This is explained here:
http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings.html#CustomSaveState
and can be seen in Android's implementation of EditTextPreference:
http://grepcode.com/file/repository.grepcode.com/java/ext/com.google.android/android/4.1.1_r1/android/preference/EditTextPreference.java/

Basically it's a giant PITA and turns an otherwise tidy piece of code
into a bloated, steamy pile of dog doo. So I stuffed as much as I could
into a separate class, SavedStringState.  While I was at it I made one
for integers as well.  Others can be parceled using the same pattern.

For some reason, it didn't seem necessary in my testing, but maybe
there's a corner case where it's critical.  Anyhow, it's the official
Android approach, so that's what I guess we should do.
