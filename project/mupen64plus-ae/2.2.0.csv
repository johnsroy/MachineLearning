This controller does not produce AXIS_HAT_X and AXIS_HAT_Y signals from
the D-pad, giving it a signature unlike all other Xbox 360 controller
clones I've tried (all wired).  Instead the D-pad signals are passed as
key events for this controller instead of motion (axis) events.

In fact, the key codes from the D-pad are 0 for all directions, making
it impossible to distinguish which direction was pressed.  Will have to
make a note of this on the forum.  Unfortunately this is an O/S level
problem that we can't address, and it's probably caused by this
controller's use of a vendor-specific (non-standard) HID profile.

All devices prior to Honeycomb were assumed to have a vibrator. Since
Honeycomb, many devices don't have a vibrator.  To maintain backwards
compatibility, Honeycomb+ devices always return a non-NULL Vibrator
object, even if they don't actually have vibration hardware. Instead,
you must specifically query whether the vibrator actually exists.

I tested this on a Gingerbread device to verify that the ternary state-
ment is safe on non-Honeycomb devices.  It was safe for my device.
