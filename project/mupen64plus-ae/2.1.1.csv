We are not using the unique features of GLSurfaceView right now, so it
doesn't make sense to extend from this more specific class.  More
importantly, some Android versions are not robust to the improper way
way we are using GLSurfaceView.  For Android 4.0.4 (and only that
version) you get a null pointer exception.  We can assign dummy objects
to workaround that bug, but why bother?  So we just revert back to
extending from SurfaceView.

The crash reports related to misuse of GLSurfaceView are linked below.
Note that these are the highest-occurring unresolved bugs to date:

Thanks @Gillou68310 for discovering this one and solving it in the
previous commit.  This commit just reverts some unnecessary changes and
adds some documentation.

When Mupen is in the foreground and the device is put to sleep, the
core is shutdown before onPause() is called.  This prevented Mupen
from auto-saving.  When the device was woken, a stale auto-save file
was loaded, thus losing all the user's progress.  The previous commit
fixed that bug.
