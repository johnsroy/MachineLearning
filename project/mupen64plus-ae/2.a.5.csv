The reported info is almost identical to other 'mapphone' devices (i.e. OMAP), such as the Droid X.  The only way to distinguish this device was with the Hardware arg plus either the Android version, BogoMIPS number, or processor revision.  Additionally there were multiple entries for arg 'processor:' in the device info (first entry is actual processor info, other two list the processor index associated with the BogoMIPS data that follows).  I improved the logic here a bit so it only saves the value for 'processor:' if it is longer than one character.  This allows comparison against the processor revision.  We'll need to look at more mapphone devices to see if the logic for picking a profile based on processor revision holds true, and adjust accordingly.

Unified the binary and multi-choice custom preference classes.
Long-clicking for the notes is now handled directly by the preference,
rather than delegating to another class.
