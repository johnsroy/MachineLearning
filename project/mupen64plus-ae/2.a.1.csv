Not sure if this is just a superficial reorganization due eclipse/ADT
plugin version, or if it's significant. Let me know if this breaks your
builds. My configuration:

Eclipse 4.2.1 (Juno)
Android SDK Tools 21.0.1
Android SDK Platform-tools 16.01
Android 4.2 (API 17) rev. 1
Win7-64

Significantly increases compile speed on multi-core/thread machine.
In eclipse, right-click project->Properties.  Then go to C/C++ Build.
In upper-right corner, click Manage Configurations... and set active
the appropriate configuration for your machine.

Feel free to revert these last two commits if they break the build
process on your machine.

Another casualty of the keyname refactoring. Oh well it had to be done.
Better now than later I guess.

Originally built librsp-hle.so in thumb mode to reduce file size.  This unfortunately creates a library that is unloadable on some devices (such as the Kindle Fire HD).  Building in arm mode fixes the problem.

While not strictly required (many NDK examples do not use them), it is technically correct to use JNIEXPORT JNICALL for the JNI calls.  Also, I noticed that changing the language on my phone to one of the added languages doesn't actually do anything (it always just stays in English).
