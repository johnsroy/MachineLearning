At the moment these aren't accessible via the GUI. I added them so that
developers can hard-code the input map if necessary for debugging.

If a user had previously set a binary cheat, it was persisted as a
boolean in the datafile.  Now all cheats are persisted as integers,
even if they're binary.  A user with an out-of-date datafile would have
gotten a class cast exception when reading the boolean as an integer. I
*think* this fixes that problem.  Note that this only affects alpha
testers who have set binary cheats in previous release candidates.

This means cheat options are also persisted to the default data file as
well, and can be reset from the settings menu like all the rest.

but it works.

None of the other preference screens are animated when the user nav-
igates up and down the hierarchy. So we remove it here as well. (The
reason it's animated in the first place is because the Play menu
resides in its own activity.)
