Still difficult to map the left analog nub, since it sends both
AXIS_X and AXIS_HAT_X (and Y) at the same time.  But all other axes and
buttons are easily mapped now.

This should fix issues with other composite controllers, such as the
OUYA controller, which combine mouse emulation and joysticks on one
device.

The InputMapPreference UI is too limiting for the many functions needed
during input mapping. This is because it uses a neutered version of an
AlertDialog provided by DialogPreference. We need more control, namely
a simple way to add extra menus and callbacks, without the limitations
of the AlertDialog UI and without the show/hide semantics forced by
DialogPreference.

So we give the input mapping process its own activity.  This commit
provides most of the implementation for that activity, but stops short
of actually replacing the old InputMapPreferences in the menu.  This
commit provides a possible branch point for testing the new activity
while safely maintaining all of the existing UI and functionality.

Controller enabled/disabled is persisted as its own boolean now, rather
than being serialized with the input map. This is much more logical and
easier to maintain in the long run.

Fewer buttons/axes are mapped by default now, to minimize conflicts out
of the box.  They are
- analog stick <-> AXIS_X and AXIS_Y
- d-pad <-> KEY_DPAD_* (no AXIS_HAT_*, conflicts w/ Nyko PlayPad)
- start, R, L buttons to their virtually universal keycodes

A TogglePreference was implemented.  Basically a fancier version of a
checkbox preference.  Besides the slider/toggle widget, the main
difference is that clicking on the list item in the preference menu
does not do anything (checkbox preference it toggles the check state).
This is so that you can handle the click in your own custom way, e.g.
to launch an activity like InputMapActivity.  To change widget state,
you need to click on the widget itself. This imitates the 'master on/
off switch' pattern used in the Android settings:

I had assumed the appropriate choice was ENGLISH, then I came across
this while looking into the Locale API.  From
http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html

Quote:
The default locale is not appropriate for machine-readable output. The
best choice there is usually Locale.US â€“ this locale is guaranteed to
be available on all devices, and the fact that it has no surprising
special cases and is frequently used (especially for computer-computer
communication) means that it tends to be the most efficient choice too.

Example:
To provide users the choice between French (France) and French (Canada)
just update the string array in res/values/arrays.xml to include fr_FR
and fr_CA.

In such cases, you should include the following resource directories:
res/values-fr
res/values-fr-rCA
res/values-fr-rFR

Non-regionalized French resources should be maintained so that a user
whose system locale is French (Switzerland) will still see a French
translation.

This commit considerably improves the input mapping experience.
- Multi-button highlighting (easier to detect issues like Nyko PlayPad
ganged AXIS_X and AXIS_HAT_X (and _Y) inputs)
- Auto-classification of analog channels into sticks, triggers, or
unknown
* Classification defines how the channels will be normalized
- stick: range normalized to [-1, 1]
- trigger: range normalized to [0, 1]
- unknown: range not normalized
* In coming updates, user will be able to override the auto-class-
ification, e.g. to address Xbox 360 unorthodox triggers
- Profiles menu added; for now just a few hard-coded profiles
* Empty: just unmaps everything
* Default: for OUYA, PS3, and many of the new bluetooth controllers
* Xbox 360: provides workaround until manual classification ready

The implementation required either expanding LazyProvider or removing
its use from InputMapActivity.  I chose the latter, with the hope that
it will soon be eliminated altogether.
