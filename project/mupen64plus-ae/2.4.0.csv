screens had a black background), and more

This fixes the topdown prerendered background in Link's hut (Zelda
OOT). Previously this background would be a bunch of polygons on a
green screen.

Also helps get Biohazard 2 ingame with glN64. It would previously crash
hard.

Considering we didn't directly fix it, it's only fair that the original person that uncovered/fixed the bug get his name credited.

Had a look at this issue -
http://code.google.com/p/mupen64plus/issues/detail?id=553

Implemented the proposed fix on my own and that got rid of the spurious
crashes for me.  BTW - Misschief Makers is another game that reports
this warning 'two events of same type interrupt queue'. Anyway,
returning when that happens gets rid of the crashes in PD.

littleguy note: You might need to delete any pre-existing .eep and .mpk
files from the SlotSaves directory and reset the game the first time
you run with this fix.  More discussion here:
