SDL 2.0 cannot store unicode anymore. Pre-2.0 versions provided this
field but it was removed right before the 2.0 release. Still using it
makes the compile fail.

Addresses Issue #197

This setting is useful for games like Jet Force Gemini that have in-
game widescreen settings.  The ROM itself letterboxes the video (adds
black bars to the top and bottom).  Adding a 'crop' option to the
scaling mode allows us to stretch to the full width of the screen and
crop the unneeded black bars that the ROM adds.

is the GameActivity (as it should be).

The complicated CRC check can be replaced with a simple String.format
operation. Note that the new implementation isn't identical to the old
in every way: before you could get CRC's like '0 0' from the native
side, which would then be turned into a null after the check.  Now, if
given the same file, the final CRC would be '00000000 00000000' instead
of null.  However, at the end of the day, this makes no difference to
the downstream code; it will just fail to find a cheat entry in either
case.

These files don't belong in the git repository since they are user-
specific and subject to change based on eclipse version.  After merging
this commit, you will need to regenerate your own version of these
files.  Here's how:

1. In eclipse 'Delete' the project from your workspace (but don't
delete the actual files)
2. Close eclipse and manually delete the above three files (if they
aren't already)
3. Open eclipse and File->Import... 'Existing Android Code Into
Workspace'
4. Right-click project->Android Tools->Fix Project Properties
5. Right-click project->Android Tools->Add Native Support...
a. Enter name 'Dummy' and click Finish
b. Manually delete jni/Dummy.cpp
6. If you want multi-core compilation (dramatically faster builds),
go to Project->Properties->C/C++ Build
a. Uncheck 'Use default build command'
b. Set build command to
ii.  'ndk-build -j3' if your build machine runs 2 cores
i.   'ndk-build -j6' for 4 cores
iii. 'ndk-build -j12' for 8 cores
iv.  etc.
7. For auto-formatting the Java code (ctrl-shift-f), be sure to
import the formatting settings located in ./doc/config_files/

When this is all done, the C/C++ indexer should work properly and
resolve #includes correctly.  The drawback (besides the initial
recreation) is that you'll have to redo this process every time you
jump to an old revision where the files are tracked, then jump back to
the newer revision.  The easy solution to this is to just back up your
untracked files and restore them every time git deletes them after the
reset.
