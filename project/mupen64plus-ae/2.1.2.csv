The purpose of OUYAInterface.java is not only to consolidate all
interactions with the ODK, but also to address any concerns about
compliance with the GPL v3, by interfacing with the ODK in a way that will
allow the app to be built from the unmodified source code without linking
to the ODK jars.

@ecsv Sven - If this messes up your workflow for pulling changes from
upstream, please let me know and we can rewind/revert this commit.

I've been staring at this code for awhile so I thought I'd push over
some of the cleanup I did in my experimental branch.  This gets rid of
a lot of diff noise.  Should make it a little easier to spot the real
changes between up and downstream.

Note that this only changes whitespace and comment text. The only
implementation that I changed was to move some variable declarations
inside some for loops, merely to match the upstream implementation.  If
you see any other changes to the implementation, please note them right
away because they probably are an error.

Apparently, this should auto-magically detect the appropriate OpenGL
variant to use for the platform. See <SDL_config.h>.  In our case SDL
keys off of the ANDROID symbol to determine that gles2 should be used.

We should probably use the SDL_VIDEO_OPENGL* family of symbols for
targeting code to different GL platforms.

TODO: Test with other platforms to be sure the OpenGL compiler paths
are used appropriately.

The windowXpos and windowYpos configuration settings are not being
used presently.  The windowHeight and windowWidth settings seem to
duplicate the functionality already provided by VIWidth and VIHeight
in the upstream version.  Removing these elements does not seem to
make a difference in any of my tests (including Super Mario 64).  If I
am missing something, please let me know.

If Mario 64 and the others need their height re-scaled, I suggest that
we revisit the topic after upstream synchronization.  If the changes
are indeed necessary, then I'm sure the upstream community will
appreciate them.  Right now I do not see any impact in removing them
anyhow.

Since the getName() method contains the word 'OUYA' for an OUYA
controller, this can be used to identify OUYA controllers without
using the ODK.  This allows the axis compensation to be applied
even if an OUYA controller were being used on an Android device
other than an OUYA.  It also avoids the bugs reported in ODK 1.0.0
related to the getPlayerNumByDeviceId method.
