If pathname isn't null, then getName can't be null.

Plus, getName returns an empty string if no filename is in the path.

valueOf = return an object of the given type. ie. Integer.valueOf( var ) returns an Integer.
parse[type] = return primitive of the given type. ie. Integer.parseInt( var ) returns an int.

Some of the methods were of a primitive type, yet returned a statement using valueOf. Only parse[type] is needed in this case.

Previously someone could have made a file named 'zip' (without an extension) and it would attempt to load it as an actual ROM. Whoever does this with files other than ROMs is obviously pretty damn daft, however better get this out of the way before someone does do that.

Made it check for a file with a length of at least 5 characters in length because the minimum length for a file with a zip extension is 5 characters (ie. 'a.zip')

Also changed the cosmetic look of the simplified version of the condition that was simplified in the previous commit.

Fixes an if statement.

The way it is now, cache.hash.insert(cache.bottom->crc, NULL); gets executed regardless of the condition (the ; on the if statement terminates it).

You really don't want to set the bottom-most element's data of the texture cache to NULL unless the cached texture you're actually working with is the bottom-most texture itself.
