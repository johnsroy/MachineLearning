-fexceptions
Moved to LOCAL_CPP_FEATURES := exceptions
From android-ndk-r8e/docs/ANDROID-MK.html:
'It is recommended to use this variable instead of enabling -frtti
and -fexceptions directly in your LOCAL_CPPFLAGS definition.'

-lz
Moved from LOCAL_LDLIBS (gles2rice) to LOCAL_EXPORT_LDLIBS (png)
Again, from android-ndk-r8e/docs/ANDROID-MK.html, the recommended
way for a static lib (i.e. png) to let its clients know what system
libraries (i.e. zlib) they must link with is to use the flag
LOCAL_EXPORT_LDLIBS.

-shared

-llog
Not needed by core.

I reverted the SDL_android_main.cpp to upstream SDL revision 4999 (on

Rather than modifying the names of the SDL functions to match the java

exported functions.  Again, just minimize the diff with SDL upstream.
This also makes the transition to SDL 2 a bit cleaner.

Also, I decided not to wrap onNativeAccel, since we don't use it.

Also the width and height calculation was simplified to an equivalent
