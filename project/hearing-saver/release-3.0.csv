It looks like the error happens because multiple instances of the broadcastreceiever get spun up, which means that the first one correctly saves the previous ringer state, but the next one sees it as 'silent', and saves that as the old state. This means that once it gets restored, it just gets set back to silent anyways and bam - bug.

The previous change fixed part of the problem, and this fixes the rest.

The receiver (I think erroneously) gets called when it is registered. This means that when the user starts the service for the first time, reboots, or when the service is destroyed and restarted by the system, their volume will be set. Aside from being unintended behavior, it also causes their 'old mode' to be overwritten, which means that if they are already plugged in (and the ringer is muted), their old mode will be saved as silent and the ringer will *not* be turned back on when they unplug. To prevent this, I'm using a member variable to record if it is the first try or not.

The issue at hand was actually caused by a bug in the Android OS, introduced in 2.3, and extant in 3.0 as well (see https://groups.google.com/d/msg/android-developers/2H-zkME9FB0/ZymfmZTDaAkJ). There was an offered workaround for the issue, which apparently works. Hopefully this problem doesn't come up again.

Removed all the service foreground stuff, as it was just a workaround and shouldn't be neccessary.
