MifareClassic.readBlock(i) must return 16 bytes or throw an error.
At least this is what the documentation says. On Samsungs Galaxy S5
and Sonys Xperia Z2 however, it sometimes returns < 16 bytes for
unknown reasons (maybe due to an corrupted block?!).

finish() is non-blocking and the code afther it could
be executed.

This way MCT will no longer crash if the KeyMapCreator is
started with null als EXTRA_KEYS_DIR. This happes for some
useres. I don't know why. MCT never runs the Activity with
null as EXTRA_KEYS_DIR!

On some devices the block symbol is not implemented in the
monospace font. Therefore a different font with another width
is chosen. This messes up the whole output of the diff tool.
