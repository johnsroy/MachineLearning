Instead of having to manually update the version number in the string
resources for the about dialog, it now contains a placeholder string
which gets replaced by querying the version number from the package
manager. In release 0.2 I forgot to update the string so this should
fix that problem.

In the article file, the span offsets are stored as a count of UTF-16
code points to make it easier to work with from a Java string.
However, to make it easier to generate a database targetted for other
applications, this patch makes it now store the offsets in memory as
UTF-8 byte counts. They are then only converted to UTF-16 offsets as
the file is written.

it now expects a -i and a -o option.

This adds a -s option to save the database in a single file. The idea
is that a separate utility program could access this database. The
format is slightly different and is intended to be easier to access
from a Linux system instead of Android.

This adds a tool for showing an article from the single file database.
It takes an optional language code and a word from the index and
displays the strings from the article. The idea is eventually to
format these strings either with nroff or html and display them in
some pager.

The tool can also complete language and word names with the intention
that eventually this could be integrated with bash completion to make
a convenient command line dictionary.

The generated article for the prevo tool is now passed on to a bash
subprocess which sets up a pipe between groff and less. Groff is
configured to parse a man page. The article is still generated as
normal text but the idea is to change it be in nroff format.

The prevodb project now no longer solely relates to the Android
version of PReVo so I think it makes sense to live in its own repo.
The code has been moved to:

When a long press is performed on the text view for a definition it
now pops up a context menu with an option to copy it to the clipboard.
The definitions are now represented in a tiny subclass of TextView
which stores some extra context menu information to grab the text back
out.

The clipboard is set using a helper class that will either use HTML
data or plain text depending on is supported by the SDK. The
appropriate methods are retrieved using reflection so that it won't
break on older Android.

This adds two menu items to the context menu that get shown for each
definition which will create a flashcard either with the word on the
front and the definition on the back or vice versa. The flashcard is
created by just launching the intent
org.openintents.action.CREATE_FLASHCARD. At least Anki handles this
but presumably there may be other flash card apps that can do this
too.

There is now a menu option in the article view to 'zoom' the text.
This will create and display an instance of ZoomControls with a
timeout so that it will be hidden after 10 seconds of not pressing the
buttons. When the buttons are pressed a configuration option is
updated which causes the text size to change. There are 10 text sizes
which are used to scale the original text size of the layouts.
