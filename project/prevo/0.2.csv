The app is reasonably large and it doesn't have any services so it
probably makes sense to install it on an SD card.

insertWithOnConflict is not available in Android 2.1. Looking at the
code, it just seems to generate a statement anyway so it doesn't look
like there's any advantage to it over just using execSQL directly.

The String conversion methods that take an explicit Charset object are
only available since API level 9. If you don't specify a Charset
object then it will use the 'default charset' which as far as I can
tell is always UTF-8 on Android. This should make it work on Android
2.1.

of the XML files in the revo zip file and outputs a list of <ref> tags
which point to a missing mark.

Embedded linked lists are more efficient and convenient for some

The icon looked a bit naff on the home screen because it was being
scaled up. This adds ldpi, hdpi and xhdpi versions of it so Android
can pick the right size.

The icon ID has been renamed to ic_launcher and the old icon that was
in the stub package has been removed.

If a link is found to a missing mark, instead of immediately giving up
on the mark it will now try increasingly less precise marks until it
finds a match. The mark is made less precise by removing one of the
components separated by dots. It sounds like some of the articles
deliberately point to a section that is expected to be written later
so this should at least let it find the right article.

Any uzo tags that have the tip attribute set to ‘stl’ will now be
expanded instead of showing the abbreviation.

PdbDbRefType has been replaced with PdbReplacement so that the code to
look for the right replacement in the list can be shared.

The element handlers for spannable string elements can now set a flag
on the parse state to ignore the element's children. This is needed to
avoid adding the abbreviation once its expansion has been added.

The article and search activities now have menus to jump back to the
language selection and search activities. There is a common menu class
with static utility methods to implement the menu actions. Whenever a
language is selected, a preference is updated to store the last
language. When the search option is pressed the search for the last
used language is shown.
