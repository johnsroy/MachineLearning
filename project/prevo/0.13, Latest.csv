This is removed when the menu is created so it is pointless to list it
in the menu resource. This was left around from when the menu resource
was shared between multiple activities.

Instead of each SearchActivity loading its own copy of the trie, they
are now cached in a static class so that they can be shared. The cache
only keeps the last 5 used indices so that if the user switches
between a lot of languages it won't use up too much memory.

The trie is now loaded on-demand from the cache whenever a search is
initiatied rather than keeping it around forever. This should usually
hit the trie cache so it shouldn't cause any delays but it also has
the benefit that if the user opens a bunch of activities with many
different languages then the garbage collector will get a chance to
collect the tries. They will be loaded again when a new search is
started on the activity.

When searching if no results are found it will now try searching in

it will display the results from that language instead.

If MenuHelper.goSearch is called (ie, from the start activity or from
the generic search button) we don't want it to mark the language as
used because it's just using the default language so the user hasn't
really explicitly selected it. To make this work there is now an extra
string on the intent to specify if the language should be marked as
used.
