Instead of allocating a separate tiny buffer every time an integer is
read, it now conserves the buffer as a private member variable.

The prevodb tool now adds language codes to each section of the
article so that eventually the app can selectively show translations.
Currently these codes are just skipped.

Sometimes it's difficult to remember which language you are searching
in so this patch makes it display the language's code in the title.

This adds a shared preference called ‘selectedLanguages’ which is a
comma-separated list of language codes. If this is set then the
article activity will skip sections of the article that have a code
which isn't in the list and the languages activity won't list
the unselected languages.

There is a new class to help parse the comma separated list which
stuffs the language codes into a sorted array so that it can be binary
chopped.

There is currently no UI to change the seting.

The LanguagesActivity has been renamed to SelectLanguageActivity and a
new activity with the old name has been created to decide which
initial activity to show depending on the preferences. If the user has
previously already selected a language it will jump straight to the
search page for that language, otherwise it will default to the select
language activity.

The list of languages should never change throughout the lifetime of
the program so in order to aid sharing the list with other adapters it
is now stored in a shared global object. There is a new class to wrap
the array and it includes functions to search for a name given a code
by binary chopping the list.

This adds a list activity with all of the languages with a check box.
The user can select which translations to display. This sets the
selectedLanguages preference.

The article and select language activities have been modified to
register for preference changes on create and destroy instead of start
and stop. When the UI switches to another activity the old activity is
usually stopped so it is not enough to cause it to reload the state.
However to avoid redundantly reloading state for invisible activities,
it now queues a reload when the pref changes and only actually reloads
when the activity is started again.

Two strings from the language selector activity were encoded directly
in the source code instead of being in the resource file. Also for
some reason they were all in capitals. This has been fixed.

Previously if there was a non-default font size then it would try to
set the size on the views before the article has actually been loaded.
This patch changes it to delay setting the font size when there is a
reload queued. The font is always reset after the article is loaded
because the new views will again have the default size.

This patch also moves some initialisation out of loadIntendedArticle
into onCreate.
