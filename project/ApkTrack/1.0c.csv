Also removed another hardcoded string.

* Added a toast message when there is a network error after a user requests a version check.
* Removed a bunch of `Sting.format` calls, after figuring out that `getResources.getString` had a built-in way to recieve format arguments.
* Added a concept of 'source' (the requester) for version checks.
* Background checks can now be cancelled mid-cycle.
* Version bump.
