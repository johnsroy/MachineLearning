* An actionBar has been added to perform basic actions:
- Check  latest version for all applications (takes all day, though)
- Detect newly installed applications.

I'll probably update the detection mechanism to use intents.

* Installation and uninstallation detection is now tested. It even seems to work.
* Added a service to check for updates in the background on a daily basis.

Feature-wise, I'm more or less where I wanted to be. But there's now so much coupling in the code that I believe a huge refactoring phase is due.

Improvements: now it works. Updates should be checked automatically every day.
Notifications are displayed when new versions are available.

Next, the Service and the Activity should communicate.
Also, the application should detect installed and removed applications.

* Added a second website (AppBrain) to scrape if the Play Store returns 'Varies with the device'.
* Removed a lot of processing from the UI thread, and added a nice loading icon to indicate that the application is working.
* Data can now be refreshed when the application gains focus, in case the background service has detected new available updates.
* Reduced the delay between two web requests to 2 seconds.
* Corrected the regular expression used to detect if a string is a version number.
* More logs.
* Less bugs.

* Added the option to switch back to alphabetical sort.
* CWAC Wakeful library's had automatically been prepended with the GPL header by my IDE. The original license has now been restored, sincerest apologies to @commonsguy.
* BUGFIX: GMail & Google Play Services were erroneously flagged as error, because their version string contains spaces. The regular expression has been updated to circumvent this.

* Removed some code duplication between updates occurring in the Service and those triggered manually by the user. Everything is unified in a single service performing web requests, and returning results through Intents.
* Removed useless parameters all over the VersionGetTask and AppPersistence classes.
* Indonesian and polish translations contributed by XDA members. Thanks!

A lot of testing is still needed.

* InstalledApp wasn't Serializable because of its Drawable field. It was made Parcelable.
* Added additional counter-scraping-countermeasures for AppBrain.
