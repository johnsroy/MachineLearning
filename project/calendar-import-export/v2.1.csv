caltool.py converts test files into .ics files for importing. It allows test
cases to remain minimal by excluding irrelevant items. Valid .ics files are
generated by supplying missing properties.

Test files can also be converted into 'real' calendars to test round-tripping
of the various test cases via other s/w.

This fixes the parsing and output of organizer so that it contains just the
actual to: part of the mailto: URI. This should fix the value in the Android
DB and so fix any check where the calendar owner is compared to the
organizer. It doesn't tell us why GUESTS_CAN_MODIFY isn't working however.
Lets see if this is enough to fix #29 for the reporting user.

Issue #27 was not an app error but user confusion due to the Insert/Delete
buttons being hidden on their screen. Scroll the view to make the buttons
visible when shown in order to prevent confusion in the future.
