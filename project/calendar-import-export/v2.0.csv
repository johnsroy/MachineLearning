Add an option for UID's to be global across all calendars, defaulting to off.
Add another duplicate handling option to replace duplicate events in the

Although UIDs are meant to be globally unique, it can be counter-intuitive
to have events in other calendars changed without having configured the app
to do so.

This change reworks the processing code to hide some of the added complexity,
and prevents the query for duplicates being run twice. It also fixes the

This completes the changes required for issue #19.

Unfortunately this also means we get the build warnings and language

mavens backport-util-concurrent-3.1 file ideally.

We will need extended logging to debug user issues.

When enabled, verbose and debug messages are output as information messages
so they are not filtered nor is the code stripped out at runtime. In debug
builds the option has no effect.

Also information level logging was being filtered in debug builds which is
counter to the logging documentation on usage. Information messages are
now always output.

This works by using events containing an X-TEST-NAME and then

checked against the resulting ContentValues that (in non-test mode)
would be inserted into the DB.

This approach has its limitations but it allows us to start testing
the many permutations of inputs and to prevent regressions. The test
support can be incrementally improved as tests are added.
