The files are saved to $HOME/downloads/, after which the user
may choose to open the downloads/ folder or edit the file with
the $HOME/bin/termux-file-editor program.

It's also possible to receive URL:s, in which case the
$HOME/bin/termux-url-opener program will be called.

By appending the old system PATH environment variable to the paths
setup by Termux system binaries are found as a fallback.

This causes problems with system binaries not working (due to
LD_LIBRARY_PATH) and causing a lot of confusion for new users when
e.g. an Android system provides a system version of e.g. curl, ssh
and other programs. It's better for these users to be prompted to
install the proper Termux package, and advanced users can still
add /system/bin to the PATH themselves.

Certain programs such as 'am' and 'pm' are already setup in
$PREFIX/bin to clear LD_LIBRARY_PATH and launch the binaries in
/system/bin - if there are some more popular ones they could be
added in the same way.

This will only affect new installations. Existing users wishing to
install 64-bit packages can re-install the app completely, or just
'rm -Rf $PREFIX' and exit all sessions, which will cause Termux to
re-install all packages at next startup.
