The original reason for intercepting the escape key in onKeyPreIme()
was to prevent the escape key as being treated as the Back key before
reaching onKeyDown().

This seems no long necessary, and may mess up handling the ...+1
combination for escape on the Google Pixel C keyboard (see #27).

The initial bootstrap zip was previously downloaded from
http://apt.termux.com, which lacked security and was not behind a CDN.

By moving to https://termux.net we improve security (as it's https)
and reliability (as it's using a CDN).

Fixes https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/89.
