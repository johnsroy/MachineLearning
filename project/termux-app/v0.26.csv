- Make text selection easier and quicker by selecting text directly on long press, and using standard grip bars for changing the selection.
- Disable the drawer while selecting text.
- Fix problem with selecting snippets of text with wide unicode characters at start and end.
- Remove the 'tap-screen' configuration option for a more common show keyboard behaviour when tapping the terminal.
- Do no longer map the back key to escape by default - but it's still possible to do by configuration.
- Add new hardware keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+K for toggling soft keyboard visibility.

This avoids the terminal content from being pushed down when starting
text selection. The drawback is that one cannot select text at the
top rows without scrolling - something to fix for the future.
