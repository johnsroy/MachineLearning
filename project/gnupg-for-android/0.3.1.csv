This will differentiate the debug builds from the normal builds. The debug
builds will never be upgraded by the release builds since the debug builds
will always have a much larger versionCode.  Also, the date it was built
will show up in the version string, making it easier to identify debug
builds versus release builds.

install is complete and it tries to dismiss the dialog.

Things are changing in gpgme, on platforms where PATH is used, gpgme is now
using PATH to find the tools it needs. This is a no go on Android, so there
is a new option for setting a fixed path to look for the GnuPG utils.
