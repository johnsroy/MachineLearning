The GnuPG projects (gpg-error, libassuan, gcrypt, etc.) use their own custom
*-config scripts that are something like pkg-config.  They are meant to be
installed before using, and don't handle cross-compiling well.  So we set
the prefix= to the full path where they exist on the build machine, then
the *-config scripts work for building.

Since Android doesn't use the rpath at all anyway, the shared libraries are
relocatable anyway, as long as LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to point to where the
shared libraries are installed on the device.

From SDK Tools : ( SDK Tools, Revision 8 (December 2010) )

Support for a true debug build. Developers no longer need to add the
android:debuggable attribute to the <application> tag in the manifest — the
build tools add the attribute automatically. In Eclipse/ADT, all incremental
builds are assumed to be debug builds, so the tools insert
android:debuggable='true'. When exporting a signed release build, the tools do
not add the attribute. In Ant, a ant debug command automatically inserts the
android:debuggable='true' attribute, while ant release does not. If
android:debuggable='true' is manually set, then ant release will actually do a
debug build, rather than a release build.
