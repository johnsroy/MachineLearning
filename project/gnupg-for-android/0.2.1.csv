Emacs now has a built-in Java mode for its code formatter, use that instead
of the comment to describe the code format.  Also, Eclipse's code formatter

It seems that Android 4.3 has different default permissions than the rest,
so we explicitly set the permissions of environment.conf so anything can
read it.  That's what it is for anyway: to config gpg for any app/user.

If a key has no signature data, or the key list most does not include
signature data (i.e. GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_SIGS), then siglist will be null.
The methods that call getSignatures() should handle a null return value.
