iconv is a library for converting between different formats.  Since Android
should be all UTF-8, there should be no need for iconv.  Its been working
so far without it, so I'm purging the iconv stuff.

Here's the thread:

Because GPG is all based on the Contacts stuff, GPG will not work when CM

The layout of where the test binaries are built has changed, so move all
branches to the latest libksba so that the install logic in
external/Makefile does not need to have multiple cases.  Plus it looks like
libksba is due for a release anyway, and the Android build relies on stuff
that is not in the latest release.
