"f84369bc19313d351049696a47ef02112af86866","2011-08-16 02:11:04-07:00","Add new conversations to DeckAdapter in onResume()

Currently, when the user opens a ConversationActivity, goes off to do
something else without closing it, and then comes back to the activity,
conversations started since the ConversationActivity was paused (e.g. by
an incoming private message) will not appear in the ConversationGallery;
this is because we never check for new conversations in the onResume()
path.

Fortunately, this is an easy fix: we're already looping over all the
conversations in onResume() in order to add new messages to the
MessageListViews, so just look out for the new conversations and add
them to the ConversationGallery when we see them.
"
"e07d99ed5d0d641031c31a10c9b999aeffdbcb4b","2011-08-16 02:11:28-07:00","Remove views from DeckAdapter when corresponding conversation has gone missing

If a conversation disappears while the activity is paused (e.g. if the
user is kicked from a channel, or if another client attached to an
irssi-proxy has chosen to leave that channel), we currently aren't
removing the view from the DeckAdapter when we resume.  This results in
leaking a Conversation object until the user explicitly asks for the
conversation to be closed or the activity finishes, and is also
confusing because the user may not receive any indication that the
channel was parted in the first place.

There's a good case for leaving the MessageListView in place, with a
note indicating that the user has been kicked or parted from the
channel, but for that to work, we need to keep the Conversation object
in the server's list of conversations -- otherwise the behavior will
differ depending on whether the user left the activity via the Back
button or the Home button, which is counterintuitive.

For now, just remove the stale view from the DeckAdapter, which fixes
the leak and the potential user confusion.

On Ice Cream Sandwich, something -- possibly even in the Android
framework classes (not in our code) -- is passing in null to a
MessageListAdapter's unregisterOnDataSetObserver(), which causes a
crash.

We should really find out whether this is something we can properly fix
or not, but in the meantime, wrap the superclass's method with our own
method which checks for null before calling through to the superclass
implementation.
