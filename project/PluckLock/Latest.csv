This means we don't have to do complicated stuff like check for
acceleration deltas in place of just reading instantaneous acceleration:
it's harder to lock yourself out by setting a threshold below 1 (which
you'd have to fix while skydiving, heh);

this threshold threshold will prevent people from locking themselves out
of their phone: they need only set the phone down now if they want to
change the preference

it's a little annoying if you're in the middle of unlocking your phone and
you activate this. Realistically it should never happen because that would
mean your threshold is set too low, but maybe you're unlocking to change
your threshold ;)

not sure which change fixed it, especially because of the new security
features from android 3.1. but it works now. you might need to manually
start the app once for it to start working on reboot.

Stupidly, I had neglected to STOP polling the accelerometer once the
screen was locked. Which made it drain battery *really* quickly.

Turns out the Android API is broken and won't stop polling the
accelerometer no matter what, even if you call unregisterListener(). The
receiver will just keep receiving legit samples and calling your receiver
method, even after you set everything to null. And battery still drains
a LOT.

I removed this because I thought it was inefficient, but I've just realised that the reason I had that there in the first place was that otherwise you couldn't really change the threshold -- not without killing the Service somehow first.

I might still move some of this out of the event listener to improve efficiency.

This will prevent users from having insanely low thresholds when they
update to the version that does not store acceleration in terms of g.

This also includes a version update because otherwise it would be awkward.

This commit is untested right now; I won't push it until after I've tested
it, but I can't really test it without committing because I need to
install an old version first.
