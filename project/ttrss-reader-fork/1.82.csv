Modified rules of Android  Studio to my liking:
- Tabs instead of spaces (Why did I use spaces in the first place?)
- Auto-Format on save has to be configured manually by adding a macro: http://stackoverflow.com/a/24852899
- Simple If-Statements are changed to one-line-statements now, I found now sane way to stop Android Studio from doing this

Applied rules to all files except localeapi. Some line-comments might be wrapped wrong.

- CustomFrameLayout has been added as a wrapper around the ListView and WebView to allow for slide animation to be calculated without absolute pixel values
- Animations for slide in left/right and slide out left/right added
- Pop-BackStack Animation is supressed in Fragments when moving direction changed to avoid contradirectional movement, instead the inverted animation is shown
- Removed unnecessary code

Minor bugfix: No recalculation of counters when not connected, they can't change in that case and I don't have to wait too long while debugging.

Cache the current list of articleIds in this Fragment. This is necessary to allow jumping between articles to stop at the end of the unread articles. The list in this fragments adapter is reloaded when there are no more unread articles but we still want to stop reading when the last unread has been reached.
