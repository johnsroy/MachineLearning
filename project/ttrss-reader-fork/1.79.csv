- Reduced visibilty where appropriate
- Introduced ReadWriteLocking in DBHelper, can be disabled in the central readLock() and writeLock()-Methods. Not sure if this is the right approach to the 'database is locked' exceptions. Right now it seems to be as fast as before.
- Refactored some code in DBHelper

-> After marking anything as read there seems to be a problem with what is actually marked. Problem existed before but has been made visible by the locking.

* Flash screen when notify is necessary and device has no vibrator
* Store size of tablet view per feed
* Fixed tab resizing in horizontal mode
* Make sure to use only one SQLite Connection throughout the whole app. Makes the UI quite smooth and you can start reading while updates are fetched in the background which was quite annoying before.
* Removed lots of dead code
* Moved some DB-Access into background tasks, missed these bits before.
