- Implemented temporary fix for strange effects on unused FrameLayouts. If the frame_sub is left empty it shows mirrored images from frame_main. Setting a background color just reduces the visibility with every mirrored image. Now I load an empty fragment into the frame.
--> If this is not necessary anymore all occurrences of the String TEMPORARY_SOLUTION_MARKER indicate a place where some stuff can be removed...
- Rebuilt the HTML template into one piece. The gained speed by splitting it and only rendering half of it with every article can be ignored since rendering only takes some 10 to 20 ms. Now all data is filled inside ArticleFragment.doRefresh().
- Slight changes to layout and colors

- Add ProgressBar which was removed from the ActionBar by Google for some reason ('more specialized widget[...]) and has to be implemented manually now. I added it to the toolbar.xml as a merge-Layout using a LinearLayout to avoid layouts below beeing moved up when ProgressBar is set visibility:gone
- Move loading of layout-width Preferences from background to foreground again since it can happen, that they are loaded too slow and produce NPEs
- Added logic to handle ProgressBar to MenuActivity and use it everywhere else

- ProgressBar cannot use themes from Lollipop on Kitkat and lower. Modified colors to be accessible from outside the theme and hardcoded light-theme colors in progressbar.xml but looking for a more generic solution to theme the progressbar.

If anyone else here is annoyed by the low-res icons of the app and is good with image processing: This app could do with a new icon set and I can't do it. :)
