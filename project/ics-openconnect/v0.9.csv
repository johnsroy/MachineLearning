If TokenImportActivity gets invoked from another app to import an sdtid
file, we will need to read the content from a file:///foo/bar URI.  So
let's restructure the code so that common functions can be used for
both intent handling and for processing the FileSelect result.

Add a file association with *.sdtid and allow them to be imported manually
from the VPN profile editor.  These may require a password but never
require entering a devid.

As is the case with passworded CTF strings, the token will be converted
into an unpassworded CTF string and stored in the profile.  We will not
store the whole XML file.

The following sequence of events was observed:

1) User clicks 'Add' to create a new profile

2) User enters the profile name and clicks 'OK'

3) onClick creates a new ConnectionEditorActivity

4) VPNProfileList.onPause() is called

5) onPause() saves the dialog state in FragCache, then dismisses it

6) When the activity is resumed, it incorrectly restores the dialog

So, let's dismiss the dialog from the onClick handler so that by the
time we reach onPause(), it is gone and FragCache will record its absence.
