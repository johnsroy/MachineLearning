Currently we just set the profile name to the same string as the hostname.
This commit tries to generate a more user-friendly name by applying some
simple heuristics:

- Try to find the first private part of the domain name (i.e. delete
.com, or .co.uk)

- Capitalize the string.  For strings <= 4 chars, assume it is an
abbreviation and capitalize all characters.
