Now that curl is a PIE binary, it won't run as-is on ICS.  Before
connecting, write out a wrapper script that either invokes curl-bin
(a PIE ELF binary) directly, or uses run_pie to execute it via dlopen().

The gcc info page says:

For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of
options that were used to generate code (-fpie, -fPIE, or model
suboptions) when you specify this option [-pie].

The output binary is exactly the same before and after making this change,
but it's probably a good idea to follow the rules anyhow.

Commit 948a60430ff5e0 ('Use new Java API to get peer cert') inadvertently
changed the format of the certificate hash, which would cause previously
accepted certs to generate a new warning.  The new scheme only hashes a
portion of the cert; the traditional cert fingerprint computes the SHA1
of the entire DER file.

So for now we will manually implement the latter scheme and preserve
compatibility with existing stored hashes.
