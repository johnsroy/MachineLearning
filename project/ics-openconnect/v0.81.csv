Android's base64 decoder rejects 'some' bad inputs, but not all of them.
This means that if a VPN profile had stored a literal certificate instead
of a base64-encoded certificate (as was the case in <= 0.7), it might get
decoded into junk data.  Through experimentation and reading the source
code, it was shown that inputs like 'a&bc' or 'ab*c' do not raise
exceptions.

So we will add a regexp to reject any base64 string with invalid
characters.  At the minimum this should cause PEM files starting with
'-----BEGIN ' to be processed as literal values, not as base64.
