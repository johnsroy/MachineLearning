For an AnyConnect VPN, the hostname is the only mandatory field.  So
make it easy for users to enter the minimal information necessary to
connect to their gateway.

Now the profile name will default to the hostname, but the user can
change them both individually from the settings editor.

Also, add code to gray out the OK button until at least one character
has been entered, to help avoid creating a profile with an empty hostname.

Fix a couple of different bugs related to TokenImportActivity updating
the VPN profile preferences:

- IDX_TOKEN_STRING was negative, so onActivityResult() was never called.

- The software_token spinner value was not refreshed when the system
'don't keep activities' setting was disabled.

- When the user clears an existing token, it makes sense to change
software_token to disabled.  But if the user just backs out of the
activity (e.g. right after he has enabled 'securid') we should leave the
setting as-is.
