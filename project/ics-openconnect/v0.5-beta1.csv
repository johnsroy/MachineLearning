Currently, editing an existing hostname in a VPN profile uses URI entry,
but adding a new VPN profile uses TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS only.
This results in different keys being available on the touch keyboard,
often replacing the '.com' key with a smiley emoticon in the latter case.

So we will change the input type used in the Add operation to use URI
entry.

On Android 4.4+, the DNS request socket can get bound to a specific
upstream interface instead of the VPN interface.  After a handoff,
sending data traffic to this socket can return EINVAL and log a Java
exception.  Fix this by creating and tearing down the socket every time
we try to send a DNS keepalive.

Most cell phones do not have a wide enough screen to display all five of

until the user scrolls over and finds it.  This is rather crummy from
a usability standpoint, so let's sacrifice the 'about' tab and move it
into its own activity (accessed through the menu).
