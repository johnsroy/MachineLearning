Since openconnect now installs its own standalone toolchains and populates
the sysroot with libraries we can use, it eliminates the need to build
extra copies of libtomcrypt and openssl for stoken and curl.

To some extent this limits parallelism in the build, but it also results
in compiling fewer modules.

These were built under the new 'standalone toolchain' scheme and are
now stripped.  This reduces the apk size by about 1MB, to ~5.1MB.

Since curl has switched to GnuTLS, this also allows us to drop the OpenSSL

In BATCH_MODE_EMPTY_ONLY, the check for empty fields is performed every
time the dialog is redrawn.  This means that if the screen is rotated
or if the app switches between foreground->background->foreground and
there is partial form input, the partial entry will be accepted when the
form is redrawn.

The fix is to remember the allFilled state for the lifetime of the auth
form.
