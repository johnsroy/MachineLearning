Commit a543c06cf428 (Allow use of x86 Linux CSD wrapper scripts) added
logic to check for e.g. '#!/bin/sh' at the start of the script, and
prepend '#!/system/bin/sh' if the interpreter was missing.  In a
subsequent commit, d08793cfcb (Copy certs into individual files), this
logic was inadvertently bypassed; stored CSD scripts would be used as-is
instead of rewritten to add the corrected interpreter line.

So, for any stored file for which isExecutable == true, we will copy
the contents to a temporary file and change the interpreter if necessary.
Handling of actual certs (not CSD scripts) should be unaffected.

Several ACRA crash reports have shown failures calling APIs that should
never fail: VpnService.prepare() or starting the intent returned by
prepare().  Display a more informative message to the user so they do not
think the application is buggy.

ICS may throw an NPE in this case.  Numerous crash reports from
4.0.1 - 4.0.4 devices have been seen.  The exact condition that triggers
removal of the non-added fragment is unclear; the most likely culprit
is a race between onTabSelected(), onTabUnselected(), and replace().

JB+ appears to be unaffected; $AOSP/frameworks/base commit acdfbcca6f91
added null checks that turn remove() into a no-op when appropriate.
