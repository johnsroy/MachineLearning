always kept at the top.

Added a readme section, which autosyncs with the readme file from the
root directory of this project. Plus a few fixes

# For android coders

Q: How do I copy and rename a file to a resource folder using android
studio gradle?

Oh, btw, did you know that this readme file is auto copied from the root
directory of the project folder, into this app's `/src/main/res/raw`
folder before being compiled?

It's quite a handy way to keep your readme file accessible in the
resource directory (e.g. so you can view the readme file from within
your app!)

Here is how to do it. Copy the code below to your gradle buildfile in
/app/src/build.gradle . (You might need to adjust the 'from' settings,
but should be self explanatory).

/*
* Based on
https://discuss.gradle.org/t/how-to-copy-and-rename-a-single-file/5956
* */
task copyreadme(type: Copy) {
from '../README.md'
into 'src/main/res/raw'
rename { String fileName ->
fileName.replace('README.md', 'readme.md')
}
}
tasks.copyreadme.execute()

Once you do that, everytime you build your file. It will auto copy the
readme file to the raw resource directory of your android project
folder. Let me know if it was handy!
