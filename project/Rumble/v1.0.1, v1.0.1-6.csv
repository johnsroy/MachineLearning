- forgot to add BluetoothAdapter into networkCoordinator adapter list (don't know why I removed it)
- lower case hashtag filter
- updating a row didn't return its rowID but number of row affected which was messing with the insertion of statustag (because of unique constraint): fixed with another query returning the rowID of the updated row

* Got rid of the NeighbourDevice class and replace it with an abstract Neighbour class declined in BluetoothNeighbour and WifiNeighbour
* change the protocol list from NeighbourDevice to NeighbourRecord.
* Clean/Sanitize code for NetworkCoordinator and NeighbourRecord

Added a MessageQueue:
* The message queue manage one single sorted list of all the status (it only keeps the ID and the score in memory)
* It centralises any operation on the status to keep the sorted list up to date
* Introduce a new BlockingQueue PriorityMessageBlockingQueue that every neighbour will holds in order to get a sublist of the most prioritized message.
* This Queue grow automatically when requested and is kept synchronised with the MessageQueue

Rumble Protocol
* Started to implement the RumbleBlock protocol
* Early design of its protocol
