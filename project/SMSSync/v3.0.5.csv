- Remove the use of robolectric for unit testing. Now android ships
native unit testing support.

- Refactor entities to use getters and setters so they can be mocked.

- Add test for post message.

- Add test for single and multiple messages synchronization.

- Fix #362 - Use the device's phone number for the `sent_to`
field instead of the `from` number.

- Fix #369 - Set imported messages from the phone's inbox `type`
to `pending` and `status` to failure. This prevents the app
from crashing when an attempt is made to fetch messages from the app's
inbox.

- Swipe to manually sync individual messages in the pending list is
is broken because there was no method call to cause the sync.
Made a call to `publishItem(int position)` when a swipe occurs.

- Add test for IP based Integration.

- When Test Ingeration button is hit, the app makes a request using
configured request method to the server. The test request doesn't
send the `message` and `from` variables to the server. This sometimes
causes validation error when the server is strict about those two
parameters. This sometimes leads to testing of the integration to
report invalid endpoint has been entered. To fix this, added a
hardcoded message and from values so those are sent along with the
secret values. This actually makes the test report that the
configured integration can actually receive messages from the app.

- Upgrade android gradle plugin

Check for null object from http client getReponse method call.
This is a quick way to fix the NPE. In the future investigate
why the getReponse call returns null.
