Add a broadcast receiver that schedules regular background
synchronizations with the new backends. This is run on boot and
onCreate in the main activity. If none are enabled, then
the schedule is removed.

Notifications would reappear after completing the task. The reason was
because an AsyncTask would handle the database operation of removing the
old notification, thus calling notifyPast before the reminder had been
cleared. Now everything is handled on a single thread. Classic race
condition.

Fixes #257
