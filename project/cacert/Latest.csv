Turns out we don't really have the resources or power to fully curate
our own CA store. So, instead, we will use Mozilla's CA store as pulled
through Debian's ca-certificates package.

We do this by fetching the git source of ca-certificates, verifying the
latest git tag, then building the trusted PEM list from Mozilla's store.
