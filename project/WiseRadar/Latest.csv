- Lots of code cleanup
- Better orientation handling (hopefully stop a rare
IllegalArgumentException from GPS Provider during 'OnResume' method)
- Initial work towards displaying user location on radar
- Fixes for certain overlays that use a black background instead of
white for transparency (Inconsistencies HO!)
- Removed reliance on 10min reset timer... was unfaithful
- Set initial zoom to a sane level
- Set max zoom higher so you can get better view
...I think that's everything....
