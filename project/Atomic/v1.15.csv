This is a half-fix. I would like, later, to make it an option to simply squash newlines and turn them into spaces (or nothing at all). In the mean time, we simply send each line in the context of the current conversation.

Currently, users are only naturally sorted which leaves their prefixes
in the mix. While this gets the ordering of users correct, it also
neglects the priority of their prefixes. For a cleaner looking sort,
users should first be sorted by their prefix, and then by their
nicknames.
