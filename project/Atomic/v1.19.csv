This hopefully fixes #55. It works for me: I can connect to Rizon, and things work fine.

So what's going on here is that yaaic had some serious state problems. _inputThread inside PircBot apparently handles sending bytes to the server as well as fetching lines FROM the server.

sendRawLine inside pIRCbot now just checks if _inputThread or _outputThread are null, making sure that if for some reason it's all broken that we don't do anything really mean and bad. As a result, I now explicitly call in places that need to make sure that _inputThread pumps things out, it's explicitly called.

OutputThread now flushes the IO before sending a line *as well as* after sending the line. This should clear up having any network problems.

IRCService apparently now has a newline stashed away in there, too. Take it as a sign of my insanity.

THis does some magical things with the IRC service. First, it makes sure
that when you start revving up the server, all your lines are sent in the
right thread context. Second, it smashes on some back-references to make
sure Android doesn't accidentially clear things when you don't want it to.

There's some things I should probably clean up later here, including not
losing the back-buffer when certain bugs yet undiscovered and reported
rear their ugly heads.
