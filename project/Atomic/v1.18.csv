State checking within the autoconnect world should fix a possible problem where I try to connect to a server that's already connected.

Network changes now schedule a reconnect. This has added a new permission (network state).
The old feature of having a reconnecting network will most likely go away soon, as it is pretty much
rendundant (this also saves batteries, as it uses broadcasts instead of
a wakelock on the system clock)

"070d03242162ffc9ee20535ef555feccaa63c024","2014-07-18 21:08:33-06:00","Improve logic for auto-reconnect (Being more explcit)

The logic for auto-reconnect was a little flakey. We want:

* Reconnection on loss enabled AND the server being up for reconnection
OR
* Reconnection on transient network AND the network being
transient

to trigger not showing the 'Your connection has broke! Reconnect?'

This fixes basic regression wherein disconnections via ping timeout and high latency drops causing problems.  Also made every call around the reconnecting server list to be synchronized. I probably need to make the call to isNetworkTransient synchronized too
