Currently, servers are not explicitly sorted which makes their order
inconsistent due to the underlying storage method of HashMaps. In order
to provide a cleaner look and feel, servers should be sorted by their
titles.

This fixes ZNC's habit of destroying channels while we're still connecting *and* a bug involving ZNC and auto-send commands.

Auto-send commands were sent whenever the server sent a response for [registered] -- This would throw you into an infinite loop when using the ZNC jumpNetwork command, as ZNC sends extraneous [registered] responses.

This implements part of the IRCv2/3 spec in that the parser now vaguely understands how to handle tags. By doing capability negotiation, we can also determine if we really *should* send SASL content over the wire.

This also adds support for timestamps in messages, which means ZNC playback should happen seamlessly. If the timestamps are strangely off, I don't know what I've done wrong.

The IRC locale is 'US' -- that is, all entries until the user-specified text should be considered in the 'US' locale. This means that commands should be uppercase'd in the Locale US. This cleans up the linter *and* solves a slight bug when using the zzz locale (for debugging)
