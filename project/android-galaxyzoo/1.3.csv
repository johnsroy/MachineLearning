Use an ic_small_* prefix on the small/contextual icons.
These should be smaller than action icons:
http://developer.android.com/design/style/iconography.html
However, I cannot find any standard prefix for these icon names,
so I invented ic_small_*.

I have not yet changed the icon sizes.

Move ic_small_accept.png, ic_small_favorite.png and ic_small_upload.png
from res/xhdpi/ to res/drawable-xxhdpi/ because xhdpi action icons
have the same pixel sizes as xxhdpi small/contextual icons:

Generate the other sizes using the Anroid Asset Studio,
using Trim=Trim, Padding=0%, Size=12dip, Padding=2dip.
