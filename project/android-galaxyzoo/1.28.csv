Because, apart from Italian, the only finished app translation
(German) doesn't have a finished decision-tree (website) translation,
and the only finished decision-tree (website) translations
don't have finished app translations.

Hopefully more app translations will be ready soon. Then I can
revert this commit.

By using changeBounds as well as changeImageTransform.
However, sometimes (not always) the image is then small when it is
'opened' in the next activity and the image often returns to
the wrong position. This seems worse so I might revert this later.
