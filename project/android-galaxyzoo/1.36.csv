seems like the appropriate thing to do.

As suggested by android-lint. This also moves the ic_launcher.png
files into mipmap-*/ folders instead of the drawable-*/ folders.
I think the idea is that devices may want to use different versions
of these images for the launcher than they would normally use for
other icons.

I don't know what advantage this has, but it is recommended here,
when using Toolbar instead of ActionBar, though just calling
ActionBarActivity.setSupportActionBar() seems to work fine
already:

This reverts commit 2f0f7b3d2b5f7c8be3b867ae203bd904dff3757e.

Because it apparently really is necessary:
