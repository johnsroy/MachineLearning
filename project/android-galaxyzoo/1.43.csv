So We get 5 of each group in the first set of 10 cached in advance.
Hopefully this won't slow down the overall download of that 10.

Unlike the sloan and candels icons, the goods_full icons are just
the full example image. But we want only thumbnails to be packaged
with the app.

The QuestionFragment's setItemId() override() will already call update() after it has
got the new Group Id and Zooniverse ID corresponding to the new Item ID.
Calling update() before they have been retrieved from the database can lead the
question ID and group ID to be out of sync. Not being able to find the
question ID in the (wrong) decision tree was then interpreted as being the
end of the classification process.

Because we always get it from the database whenever setItemId() is
called, so it is always the correct Group Id for the Item ID.
We already depend on this for the Zooniverse ID too.
