This uses this Transifex project:
https://www.transifex.com/organization/murrayc/dashboard/android-galaxyzoo
We can then push translation to transifex.

No strings were changed, but transifex adds the context comments
into the translated strings.xml, so doing this now will make
it easier to see what has changed after the next tx pull.

Because they would just confuse things now that we are using
Transifex. I can always add this back if it's useful to someone.

Call our LoginUtils.getLoggedIn() from an ASyncTask.
A user reported a crash via Google Play with this exception:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: calling this from your main thread can lead to deadlock
Strangely, that looks like a StrictMode exception, though StrictMode
is not enabled in the app, and I can't reproduce it when I enable StrictMode,
but the code really should be in an AsyncTask anyway.

Because the only finished app translation (German) doesn't have
a finished decision-tree (website) translation,
and the only finished decision-tree (website) translations
don't have finished app translations.

Hopefully more app translations will be ready soon. Then I can
revert this commit.
