And stop it from adding a newline at the end (by using Base64.NO_WRAP
instead of Base64.DEFAULT). This didn't seem to bother the server,
and the server still accepts it without the newline.

By asynchronously caching the login status (async because we are asking
the AccountManager, not being we are asking the server) in onResume()
and using that in onPrepareOptionsMenu().
However, this will incorrectly show the user as logged in if they
change their password on the web server - clients have no way
to check that the api_key is still valid, even when using the api_key
to submit a classification:
