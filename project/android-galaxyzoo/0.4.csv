Make the top fragment take up the remaining height left to it by
the bottom fragment. This is done by the following voodoo:
The vertical LinearLayout has 2 child fragments. The top one
has layout:height=match_parent and layout:weight=1.
The bottom one has layout:height=wrap_content and no layout:weight.

This was suggested by the Android layout designer, which must have
guessed what I was trying to achieve, and which knows about this
alternative voodoo.

The regular Subject layout, with the RelativeLayout (needed to make
the imageview's bitmap align properly) seems to make the Question
fragment disappear in the wide layout.
