Now that I have the OTA upgrade on my Nexus 10.
Note that the apps don't have the colored status bar, strangely.

Because I think this is sometimes happening on Android 5.0 (Lollipop).
For instance, sometimes all the action icons (and overflow menu items) are doubled,
and the question text has other questoin text underneath it.
This might be when the app has been in the background for some time
and is then reopened.
If I could find how to reproduce it reliably then I could investigate properly.

Avoid this exception:
java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can not perform this action after onSaveInstanceState.
caused by us using a FragmentTransaction during onResume().
Instead do it in the parent Activity's onResumeFragments(), where it
is apparently safer. This is very awkward Android API.
However, I cannot reproduce this after experiencing it once,
so it's hard to know if it's really fixed.

This avoids us repeatedly showing and hiding (with a progress circle
in between) images in the list view while downloading new items, caused by
our RecyclerView.Adapter being invalidated (by us) whenever the number of
items changes.
However, this cache is just a workaround. What we really need is
real cursor-based RecyclerView.Adapter, if that is even possible.
