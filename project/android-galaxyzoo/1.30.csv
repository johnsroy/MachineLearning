And ignore the wifi-only setting for login, because the user really wants
to use the network.

We already ignore the exception in the caller, because it is normal,
though we didn't actually throw the exception.
The lack of a check here might have caused us to download missing images,
though not new images, while not on wifi even while the wifi-only
setting was on.

Instead of at the bottom. This should make it easier to be sure what
version people have.
