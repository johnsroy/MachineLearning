* app/src/main/res/drawable-v21/question_answer_checkbox_background_ripple.xml:
Add a ripple drawable for Lollipop and later (API v21) as an alternative
to question_answer_checkbox_background.xml.
* app/src/main/res/layout-v21/question_answer_button.xml:
Add this alternative for Lollipop and later, to use the ripple
background instead of the regular background.

We have to specify this manually, because we have specified a custom
background, to avoid the fake button margins that Android normally
uses via its background drawable.

See github issue:
https://github.com/murraycu/android-galaxyzoo/issues/2

* app/src/main/java/com/murrayc/galaxyzoo/app/syncadapter/SubjectAdder.java:
Add checkForDeletedCachedImages(), which removes any items whose
cached images have been downloaded but no longer exist.
* app/src/main/java/com/murrayc/galaxyzoo/app/provider/ItemsContentProvider.java:
Expose the (Android) standard _data field name so we can check if the URI
in this field really points to a file that exists.
* app/src/main/java/com/murrayc/galaxyzoo/app/syncadapter/SyncAdapter.java:
doRegularTasks(): Call checkForDeletedCacheImages() during each sync.

This should help with this bug:
https://github.com/murraycu/android-galaxyzoo/issues/12
which is maybe being caused by an automatic clearing of the cache, for instance
to temporarily get enough space for an app install.
This would only avoid the initial flashing while the UI tries each item only
to abandon each one in turn when it cannot load the images.
If the user still has no subjects to classify, for instance if they are not on wifi,
but have chosen wifi-only, the explanatory message should be simpler to see.

However, this is very inefficient - most checks will succeed, and we are checking
each file each time, just for the rare (but it happens) case that the cache has
been cleared.

Only keep checking if the first ('next') item has had its images

and we'll catch that later if it happens anyway.

As we do in our other onLoadFinished() methods, to avoid an apparent Android
bug that causes multiple extra calls. This was causing showImage() to be
called with some older out-of-date item IDs, confusing our checks, as
well as being inefficient.

This seems to avoid the problem where the user is left with just a blank
image (and the question) after the UI has had to abandon some items
due to their images being deleted from the cache. Now it doesn't stop until
it has a new image or until it has complained about a lack of a suitable network
connection.

Hopefully this completely solves this bug:

This can happen sometimes, depending on the timing. Previously,
in this case, we were just silently giving up. Now the ClassifyActivity
will try to get or download a new item, and complain if it can't.

Previously, the user had to switch away from the app and back again to
force a retry. This is OK if the user reconnected manually (which requires
the user to switch away and back) but not if the reconnection was
automatic.
