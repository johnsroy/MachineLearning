Otherwise it generates a user agent based on the Java package name.
This way it is consistent with the upload which doesn't use volley
and which explicitly set the User-Agent already.
Having to do this in a method override is rather tedious.

Don't call Volley.newRequestQueue() if it would cause
an UnsupportedOperationException from the MockContext.getPackageName()

doesn't actually need to do any network IO.

This removes any existing fragments with the same ID.
At least on Andoid Lollipop, I have sometimes seen two set of fragments,
doubling the actoin icons and menu items.
This was maybe happening when we checked for the existing fragment too
soon after adding it, then adding another one when we didn't find it.
This suggests an inefficiency, but until I find that, this is safer
anyway.
