* app/src/main/java/com/murrayc/galaxyzoo/app/provider/Config.java:
Change the array of group IDs to a map of group IDs to decision tree

* app/src/main/java/com/murrayc/galaxyzoo/app/provider/client/ZooniverseClient.java:
getGroupIdForNextQuery(): Adapt appropriately.
* app/src/main/java/com/murrayc/galaxyzoo/app/Singleton.java:
Load all these XML files instead of just one hard-coded decision tree,
storing the tree in a map associated with the group ID.
* app/src/main/java/com/murrayc/galaxyzoo/app/IconsCache.java:
Take the whole map of trees instead of just one tree,
so we can load all icons for all trees.
* app/src/main/java/com/murrayc/galaxyzoo/app/QuestionFragment.java:
Add get/set_group_id().
Load the group ID from the database so we can use it to know which
tree's questions to use.
* app/src/main/java/com/murrayc/galaxyzoo/app/QuestionHelpActivity.java
* app/src/main/java/com/murrayc/galaxyzoo/app/QuestionHelpFragment.java:
Take and use the group ID here too, so we can discover the correct
example text and icons to use.
