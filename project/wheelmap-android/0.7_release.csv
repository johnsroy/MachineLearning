"fa0cf8bf91a96bed5af4122f7d0dbf3c36fb4344","2011-10-11 16:51:54+02:00","- reworked wheelchair state layout and strings to an explicit need
- slovakian translation for ws_* keys need to reflect that
- added functionality to not forget wheelchair state changes, as server needs several minutes to deliver updated info
- added app2sd, beware: needed to change build target to 2.2 to allow this. This is backwards compatible as long as there is no use of 2.2 java stuff
- added functionality to crash-logger for logging memoryclass and memory info
- reworked legal notice activity to better match credits activity
