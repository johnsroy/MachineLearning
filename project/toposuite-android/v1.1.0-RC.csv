selected tpst. The other action buttons ('export current job', 'clear
current job') have been placed to a new option menu.

Note that this is likely to change in the future as part of a job
management overhaul for the next major version of TopoSuite.

We previously created a temporary file on external storage when sharing
a file of points was needed. This is bad practice. Moreover, there is no
need to get write permission for sharing a file. Instead, we can simply
use internal storage and give temporary read permission when sharing via
intent. Hence, this is also safer.

As a consequence, I also decided to remove the default 'tmp dir' set in
App. This is not needed anymore. By doing so, we avoid a lot of
problems, notably on Android 6.0+ where it is required to ask for
permission to write to external storage.

it is updated instead of creating a new one (it should since values have

This method has no reason to be public. We actually need to serialize

history for this purpose is PLAIN WRONG, dammit!
Hence, adapt orthogonal survey and axis implantation calculation to use
bundle to serialize calculation to pass it to the result activity. Of
course, this requires the calculation to be plainly serializable.
