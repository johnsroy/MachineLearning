Some activities, such as the ones to import jobs and points, need to be
instanciated only once. This prevents from having what looks like two
instances of the application running when, for instance, importing a new
job from a tpst file via a file manager.

In some cases, the second computed solution is valid and the first one
not. In this case, we need to swap solutions and declare only the first
one is valid.
Note that the function to check if the first solution is valid was not
good enough since it ommited checking for angles < 0.0. This has been
addressed.

While there, refactor things a bit.
