Reasons for this:

* Espresso is the official UI testing framework now.
* The UI tests that were performed were pretty much pointless anyway.

Use proguard, without obfuscation enabled since it is pointless, to
shrink the release APK.

Using proguard required to add custom rules for guava and the support
library, without which the APK would either no build successfully
(without the guava rules) or build and install fine but generate runtime
crash (without the support library rules).

A huge thanks to https://github.com/krschultz/android-proguard-snippets
for some proguard rules!
