* activity launches the tracking service
* stop button stops the service
* service listens to GPS updates every 30 sec
* service sends HTTP request to my server on location change
* service stops running after 24 hours

TODO :

display 'GPS enabled/disabled' on activity

quit activity on taping stop button

settings activity for
* URL
* updates interval
* maximum service run time

Added a placeholder for network status (TODO display network status)

Note: No need to stop tracking service if net and/or gps is disabled.
Only warn that it's disabled. Then user enables it. Then service
works again without having to get back to activity and tap 'start'.
Better in case of network/gps temporarily unreachable or unvolontarily
disabled.

Streamlined code for lifecycle management :
* Activity already listens to the GPS, no need to get notified about GPS by the service
* use BroadcastReceiver only to get notified of service status updates (no need for extras)
* locationManager initialized in activity's onCreate (better than onResume)
