Changes:
* Add extra documentation for remove_item.

This isn't as silly as it sounds: iterate a list containing items with
unique metadata each, and remove_item the first one you find, placing
into a different - fine, except the remove will invariably remove the
wrong one, leading to items being duplicated and others destroyed.

Arguably it's a bug, and Inventory::removeItem should actually remove
the item you tell it to. (i.e. if the passed ItemStack has metadata,
match it). But it seems reasonable to just document the behaviour
more clearly.

* Improve string_to_pos documentation.
* Clarify dig_node documentation (return value).
* Better on_step documentation.
* get_nodemeta -> get_meta.
* Other minor fixes.

The ratios between the sizes of form elements, including text, is now
fixed, aside from variations caused by rounding.  This makes form layout
almost fully predictable, and particularly independent of player's
screen size.  The proportions of non-text elements are the traditional
proportions.

For compatibility, the way in which element positions and sizes are
specified remains unchanged, in all its baroqueness, with one exception.
The exception is that the position of a label[] element is now defined
in terms of the vertically center of the first line of the label,
rather than the bottom of the first line of the label.  This change
allows a label to be precisely aligned with button text or an edit box,
which are positioned in a centering manner.  Label positioning remains
consistent with the previous system, just more precisely defined.

Make multi-line label[] elements work properly.  Previously the code set
a bounding rectangle assuming that there would be only a single line,
and as a result a multi-line label would be cut somewhere in the middle
of the second line.  Now multi-line labels not only work, but have
guaranteed line spacing relative to inventory slots, to aid alignment.

Incidentally fix tabheader[] elements which were being constrained to
the wrong width.

Given an unusually large form, in variable-size mode, the form rendering
system now chooses a scale that will fit the entire form on the screen,
if that doesn't make elements too small.  Fixed-size forms, including the
main menu, are have their sizes fixed in inch terms.  The fixed size for
fixed-size forms and the preferred and minimum sizes for variable-size
forms all scale according to the gui_scaling parameter.

previously <stdint> was included. When 'settings.h' is included from
'settings.cpp', u64 has 'unsigned long long' length because no <stdint>
was included previously. This leads to different signatures of 'setU64' method
and linker cannot find appropriate symbol.

The best fix of this bug should be done in the Irrlicht, but as hotfix I
think this is OK and better than types changing.

Previously this bug didn't appear because there was no 'settings.cpp' file and
implementation of all methods was done in the header file.

generate the documentation.

If graphviz is installed, in particular, if the 'dot' binary is found,
doxygen is configured to generate various kinds of diagrams. Note that
due to this, the first run of doxygen can take a while.
