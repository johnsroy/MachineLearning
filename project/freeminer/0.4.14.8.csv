* Rename everything.
* Strip J prefix.
* Change UpperCamelCase functions to lowerCamelCase.
* Remove global (!) semaphore count mutex on OSX.

API functions on Windows, and used a hack on OSX).
* Add `Atomic<type>`.
* Make `Thread` handle thread names.
* Add support for C++11 multi-threading.
* Combine pthread and win32 sources.
* Remove `ThreadStarted` (unused, unneeded).
* Move some includes from the headers to the sources.
* Move all of `Event` into its header (allows inlining with no new includes).
* Make `Event` use `Semaphore` (except on Windows).
* Move some porting functions into `Thread`.
* Integrate logging with `Thread`.
* Add threading test.

The commit
8f9af57314f71aae1cc77e13f9996e13015d776d 'Add core.get_dir_list' by @ShadowNinja
has removed the implementation of the l_get_dirlist function and all its usages
from the l_mainmenu.cpp file, but hasn't removed it from the header file.

The reason why this hasn't been detected earlier is that C++ has this interesting
feature to still make it possible to create instances of classes whose never used
private methods are declared but not defined.

Use in-place locale directory if that exists, and
static one (RUN_IN_PLACE or CUSTOM_LOCALEDIR) doesn't exist.
Report to errorstream if neither static nor in-place locale
dirs exist, and report successfully found paths to infostreem.

Fixes two bugs:

-> Regression of commit [1] where if we use RUN_IN_PLACE=false,
but don't make install, locales aren't found. One might
think this is no regression, as its no bug, but all other
paths (mainmenu, etc.) are detected properly.
-> Regression of commit [1] where locales don't work on windows.

This commit adds three new parameters for the 'sheet' ore type:
column_height_min, column_height_max, and column_midpoint_factor.
clust_size is now deprecated for this ore type.

1. Do two renames:
* SER_FMT_CLIENT_VER_LOWEST -> SER_FMT_VER_LOWEST_WRITE
* SER_FMT_VER_LOWEST -> SER_FMT_VER_LOWEST_READ
Now the two define values are consistently named with the _WRITE defines
SER_FMT_VER_{HIGHEST,LOWEST}_WRITE, and to better point out what the two
serialisation versions actually are for.

2. wrap some lines in doc/worldformat.txt, and point out that the node
timers are serialized at a later point, as this can cause confusion about
what now happens (if one doesn't strictly read the if block's conditions).

3. some whitespace fixes in NodeTimerList::serialize, and one new comment.

Fixes #3196. Before, we didn't throw an error, and the engine thought the
block isn't occupied. But in fact it might be that redis is still loading,
and the block does exist in the database. The result was a cheesy map.

On world load the collision code can not see node boxes, since the

node. However, standing on a slab on world load leaded to sinking into
it until the world finished loading. Then one maybe fell further, if
the node below was not walkable.

Now, with this commit, when no node around the player has been loaded
it simply does not move the player.

where when an 'uncatched' exception is thrown inside a 'side thread',
the program doesn't abort anymore.

This led to the problem @netinetwalker experienced where the emergethread
got an unhandled exception for loading a mapblock while redis was loading,

This resulted in the server not doing any emerges anymore.

Because the count is serialized as u16, this would cause overflow.

If minetest later deserialized a mapblock with an incorrect
static object count, it would be unable to find the NameIdMapping
(which comes after the StaticObjectList) and abort with an error
such as 'Invalid block data in database: unsupported NameIdMapping

Commit

d2ca662569427d36642660314668e416bf68f3c8 'Enforce hiding nametag'

didn't fix the issue for 'client' instances, where the nametag update
was received before the object was added to the scene. This resulted
in the grey shadow on the nametag that commit tried to fix.

Thanks to @neoascetic for pointing out that there still is a shadow.

The invsize formspec element is outdated. Even though,
it is still supported, only a deprecation warning is shown,
introduced by commit [1]. The lua context passed to the
log_deprecated method added by commit [1] is NULL for the
invsize deprecation warning, as its run on the client and not
the server.

Commit [1] has removed checks for NULL inside the log_deprecated
method, resulting in a crash when a formspec with an invsize
element is parsed. This commit puts the check back.

Fixes #3260.

- setOpenedTrees(): this internal function was calling setSelected()
to update m_selected. Since setSelected() calls autoScroll(),
this caused the scrollbar to scroll back to the selected row
in some cases when that shouldn't be done.

For example, clicking the '+' to open a tree caused autoscroll.

Fix this by making setOpenedTrees() modify m_selected directly.

- setDynamicData(): set scrollbar position after calling
setSelected(), not before. This avoids setSelected()'s autoscroll
messing up the scrollbar position again.

- setSelected(): If an invisible row is selected, open all parents
of the selected row in order to make the selected row visible.

This fixes the issue where all the trees are closed again whenever
you return from the setting edit dialog to the settings tab.

Flushes the buffer of rollback actions that wait to get saved in two more situations:

1. Flushes in the destructor of the rollback. This makes the server not
forget the last < 500 rollback entries when it shuts down.

2. Flushes the rollback when /rollback_check is invoked. This is neccessary
as otherwise it leads to confusion if users want to test the rollback functionality
by placing a node and then executing the check on it, or if the actions were
very recent out of other reasons.

Fortunately, the only caller of that method was android system logging,

When compiled with optimizations, the most recent versions of clang seem
to 'optimize' out a crucial 'and %reg, 0x7FFFFFFF' instruction in noise2d(),
probably because it somehow assumed the variable n would never become greater
than that amount.
Indeed, signed integer underflow is undefined behavior in C and C++, so while
this optimization is 'correct' in that sense, it breaks lots of existing code.
Solved by changing n to an unsigned type, making behavior well-defined.

Cleanup:
* Remove volatile keyword, it is of no use at all. [1]
* Remove the enable_if stuff. It had no use either.
The most likely explanation why the enable_if stuff was there is that it
was used as something like a STATIC_ASSERT to verify that sizeof(T) is not larger
than sizeof(void *). This check however is not just misplaced in a place where we
already use a lock, it isn't needed at all, as gcc will just generate a call to
to the runtime if it compiles for platforms that don't support atomic instructions.
The runtime will then most likely use locks.

Code style fixes:
* Prefix name of the mutex
* Line everything up nicely, where it makes things look nice
* Filling \ continuations with spaces is code style rule

Added operations on the atomic var:
* Compare and swap
* Swap

The second point of the cleanup also fixes the Android build of the next commit.

It isn't possible to use atomic operations for floats, so don't use them there.

Having a lock is good out of other reasons too, because this way the float time
and the integer time both match, and can't get different values in a race,
e.g. when two setTimeofDay() get executed simultaneously.

This adds a chat console the server owner can use for administration
or to talk with players.
It runs in its own thread, which makes the user interface immune to
the server's lag, behaving just like a client, except timeout.
As it uses the same console code as the f10 console, things like nick
completion or a scroll buffer basically come for free.
The terminal itself is written in a general way so that adding a
client version later on is just about implementing an interface.

Fatal errors are printed after the console exists and the ncurses
terminal buffer gets cleaned up with endwin(), so that the error still
remains visible.

The server owner can chose their username their entered text will
have in chat and where players can send PMs to.
Once the username is secured with a password to prevent anybody to
take over the server, the owner can execute admin tasks over the
console.

This change includes a contribution by @kahrl who has improved ncurses
library detection.

* Remove trailing lines from src/sound_openal.cpp
* Don't do a horribly ugly copy of the file's path, allocating and deallocating a
10 kb buffer in the process. This copy was needed for backwards compatibility
with libvorbis 1.3.1 and earlier, as the removed comment explains.
However, even Ubuntu precise has 1.3.2 already. Dropping support and sparing
the ugly copy can therefore be considered safe.
* Actually load sounds from the memory, not caching them at the disk first,
removing the old hack. This is the main motivation for the commit.

Before, sub-makes called by make were called without make knowing they
were sub-makes. This however led make's jobserver not do its tasks,
and the build process ended up with inefficient parralelisation. This
commit fixes this by applying the two ways the make manual tells
about: putting + to the start of the line (used when ndk-build is
invoked), and exchanging 'make' with '$(MAKE)'.

Before, make complained with messages like:

make[2]: warning: jobserver unavailable: using -j1.  Add `+' to parent make rule.

This complaint can now only been seen for openssl. openssl has issues
if make gets exchanged with $(MAKE): if exchanged, above error message
is multiplied for various subdirs of the openssl source tree.

On a 4 core box, 'make -j 4' build time from 'make clean_all' cleaned
source tree could be improved from 15:34 minutes to 10:45 minutes.
This means a speedup of 45%.

The pageflip mode requires a stereo quadbuffer, and a modern graphic
card. Patch tested with NVidia 3D Vision.

The mini-map is not drawn, but that's what is done for topbottom and
sidebyside modes as well.

Also most of the time the user would prefer the HUD to be off. That's
for the user to decide though, and toggle it manually.

Finally, the interocular distance (aka eye separation) is twice as much
as the '3d_paralax_strength' settings. I find this a strange design
decision. I didn't want to chance this though, since it's how the other
3d modes interpret this settings.

Backface culling is enabled by default for all tiles, as this
is how the lua parser initializes each tiledef. We revert to
always using the value from the tiledef since it is always
read and serialized.

Mods that wish to enable culling for e.g. mesh nodes, now can
specify the following to enable backface culling:

tiles = {{ name = 'tex.png', backface_culling = true }},

Note the double '{' and use of 'name' key here! In the same
fashion, backface_culling can be disabled for any node now.

I've tested this against the new door models and this properly
allows me to disable culling per node. I've also tested this
against my crops mod which uses mesh nodes where culling needs
to be disabled, and tested also with plantlike drawtype nodes
where we want this to continue to be disabled.

No default setting has changed. The defaults are just migrated
from nodedef.cpp to c_content.cpp.

Outdated servers are always sending tiledefs with culling
enabled no matter what, as the value was previously entirely
ignored.

To compensate, we must (1) detect that we're running against
an old server with a new client, and (2) disable culling for
mesh, plantlike, firelike and liquid draw types no matter what
the server is telling us.

In order to achieve this, we need to bump the protocol version
since we cannot rely on the tiledef version, and test for it
being older. I've bumped the protocol version, although that
should have likely happened in the actual change that introduced
the new backface_culling PR #3578. Fortunately that's only 2
commits back at this point.

We also explicitly test for the drawtype to assure we are not
changing the culling value for other nodes, where it should
remain enabled.

This was tested against various pub servers, including 0.4.13 and
0.4.12.

Fixes #3598

clock_gettime() is a far better clock than gettimeofday().

Even better than clock_gettime() is that you can select either
CLOCK_MONOTONIC, or even CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW. These clocks offer
high precision time. And the _RAW variant will never roll back
due to NTP drift or daylight savings, or otherwise.

I've adjusted this code to select the right clock method auto-
matically based on what's available in the OS. This means that
if you're running a very old linux version, MacOS or other,
you will automatically get the best clocksource available.

I've tested all Linux clocksources by selectively compiling and
running a 10k+ timer test suite. In all cases I confirmed that
the 3 POSIX Linux clocksources worked properly, and were
selected properly.

I've modified the OS X compile path to use the high-res clock
source for all time functions, but I can't confirm it works or
that it compiles.

As for WIN32, I confirmed that the used clocksource is indeed
a Monotonic clocksource, so good news: that code section appears
to be exactly what it should be.

"ad884f23d4e73d38ce0f529de49591dd66cee44d","2016-01-21 01:07:38-08:00","New timer design.

I could honestly not make much sense of the timer implementation
that was here. Instead I've implemented the type of timer algorithm
that I've used before, and tested it instead.

The concept is extremely simple: all timers are put in an ordered
list. We check every server tick if any of the timers have
elapsed, and execute the function associated with this timer.

We know that many timers by themselves cause new timers to be
added to this list, so we iterate *backwards* over the timer
list. This means that new timers being added while timers are
being executed, can never be executed in the same function pass,
as they are always appended to the table *after* the end of
the table, which we will never reach in the current pass over
all the table elements.

We switch time keeping to minetest.get_us_time(). dtime is
likely unreliable and we have our own high-res timer that we
can fix if it is indeed broken. This removes the need to do
any sort of time keeping.

The engine implementation of `print` packs the varargs into a
table and passes the table directly to `table.concat`. If you
pass any value not supported by `table.concat` (particularly
`nil`), the server crashes. This is unexpected behavior, as
`print` is supposed to be able to work with anything.

This patch changes the implementation so it first converts
all arguments using `tostring`, which fixes the issue and
makes the custom `print` function compatible with the stock
Lua behavior.

Introduce a new contentfeatures version (8). When clients

then the v27 clients know that backface culling settings
provided by the server in tiledefs are bogus for mesh,
plantlike, firelike or liquid drawtype nodes.

Commit

6a1670dbc31cc0e44178bbd9ad34ff0d5981a060 'Migrate to STL containers/algorithms.'

has replaced core::map<T, bool> with std::set<T>, but didn't update
the accompanying comment saying 'value is dummy'. This happened at
two places.

As stated in this forum thread [1], I noticed that there is a
2 second interval in which inventory changes are shown on the
client. @yyt16384 found the source of these 2 seconds:
m_nothing_to_send_pause_timer is set to 2.0 every time there
are no changes to make, but this timer is not reset when
SetBlockNotSent or setBlocksNotSent are invoked. So in worst
case, the changed block will be sent over 2 seconds too late.

With this change, changed inventories are updated almost
immediately, but it causes additional connection load.

I've written several experimental bits of code that revolve around the
need for a consistent calendar, but implementing one is extremely hard
in mods due to time changes and mods overriding core.get_timeofday(),
which will conflict.

The second part of the problem is that doing this from a mod requires
constant maintenance of a settings file.

An implementation in core is trivial, however, and solves all of
these problems at virtually no cost: No extra branches in server
steps, and a single branch when minetest.set_time_of_day(), which is
entirely reasonable.

We store the day_count value in env_meta.txt.

The use case is obvious: This change allows mods to create an actual
virtual calendar, or properly account for seasonal changes, etc..

We add a '/days' chatcommand that displays the current day count. No
permissions are needed. It can only retrieve the day count, not
modify it.

This privilege allows map protection bypassing for server operators
and world moderators.

Initially I had thought that bypassing protection mods would have been
something that could entirely be done inside mods and minetest_game,
but the concept of protection is defined in core, in the code of
core.is_protected().

I don't feel that it would be logical to introduce a protection
concept in core, but not some way around that for server operators
to maintain map parts that need fixing, de-griefing or cleanup.

Others had noticed the same problems, and proposed a patch to
minetest_game. That patch is fine by itself, but it fails to add
protection bypass functionality for digging normal nodes and placing
nodes.

So, instead, we indroduce the new priv 'protection_bypass' in core,
and modify 'on_place_node' and 'node_dig' to allow bypassing node
protections if the player holds this priv.

This priv was tested with protector redo by tenplus1.

A followup patch to Minetest Game will include allowing special checks
for doors, trapdoors, chests in Minetest Game.

Protection mods will likely want to mimic the changes in their relevant
code sections.

We introduce a new nodebox type 'connected', and allow these nodes to
have optional nodeboxes that connect it to other connecting nodeboxes.

This is all done at scenedraw time in the client. The client will
inspect the surrounding nodes and if they are to be connected to,
it will draw the appropriate connecting nodeboxes to make those
connections.

In the node_box definition, we have to specify separate nodeboxes for
each valid connection. This allows us to make nodes that connect only
horizontally (the common case) by providing optional nodeboxes for +x,
-x, +z, -z directions. Or this allows us to make wires that can connect
up and down, by providing nodeboxes that connect it up and down (+y,
-y) as well.

The optional nodeboxes can be arrays. They are named 'connect_top,
'connect_bottom', 'connect_front', 'connect_left', 'connect_back' and
'connect_right'. Here, 'front' means the south facing side of the node
that has facedir = 0.

Additionally, a 'fixed' nodebox list present will always be drawn,
so one can make a central post, for instance. This 'fixed' nodebox
can be omitted, or it can be an array of nodeboxes.

Collision boxes are also updated in exactly the same fashion, which
allows you to walk over the upper extremities of the individual
node boxes, or stand really close to them. You can also walk up
node noxes that are small in height, all as expected, and unlike the
NDT_FENCELIKE nodes.

I've posted a screenshot demonstrating the flexibility at
http://i.imgur.com/zaJq8jo.png
In the screenshot, all connecting nodes are of this new subtype.

Transparent textures render incorrectly, Which I don't think is
related to this text, as other nodeboxes also have issues with this.

A protocol bump is performed in order to be able to send older clients
a nodeblock that is usable for them. In order to avoid abuse of users
we send older clients a 'full-size' node, so that it's impossible for
them to try and walk through a fence or wall that's created in this
fashion. This was tested with a pre-bump client connected against a
server running the new protocol.

These nodes connect to other nodes, and you can select which ones
those are by specifying node names (or group names) in the
connects_to string array:
connects_to = { 'group:fence', 'default:wood' }
By default, nodes do not connect to anything, allowing you to create
nodes that always have to be paired in order to connect. lua_api.txt
is updated to reflect the extension to the node_box API.

Example lua code needed to generate these nodes can be found here:

NDT_CONNECTED attempts to connect to any side of nodes that it can
connect to, which is troublesome for FACEDIR type nodes that generally
may only have one usable face, and can be rotated.

We introduce a node parameter `connect_sides` that is valid for
any node type. If specified, it lists faces of the node (in 'top',
'bottom', 'front', 'left', 'back', 'right', form, as array) that
connecting nodeboxes can connect to. 'front' corresponds to the south
facing side of a node with facedir = 0.

If the node is rotatable using *simple* FACEDIR, then the attached
face is properly rotated before checking. This allows e.g. a chest
to be attached to only from the rear side.

CUSTOM_DOCDIR changes the location of all
documentation files but one.

The best meaning of EXAMPLE_CONF_DIR is to
further allow customization of the mt.conf.example
storage place, but otherwise keep defaulting to
whatever DOCDIR is set to, at least for not in
place builds. This patch implements that
behaviour.

Fixes #3863.

Before, customisation of DOCDIR did not lead to
changes of the EXAMPLE_CONF_DIR default value.
This was inconsistent with expected behaviour
if you didn't know of the existence of the
EXAMPLE_CONF_DIR variable. The confusion is
very strong, as (for not in place builds) both
DOCDIR and EXAMPLE_CONF_DIR share the same
default value, it is unexpected that setting

ABM's are hardcoded to run every 1.0s, NodeTimers are hard coded to
run at every 1.0s. Block mgmt is running every 2.0sec.

However, these timers can be better tuned for both higher and lower
values by server owners. Some server owners want to, and have the
resources to send more packets per second to clients, and so they
may wish to send smaller updates sooner. Right now all ABM's are
coalesced into 1.0 second intervals, resulting in large send queues
to all clients. By reducing the amount of possible timers, one can
get a far better response rate and lower the perception of lag.

On the other side of the camp, some servers may want to increase
these values, which again isn't easily doable.

The global settings abm_interval and nodetimer_interval are set to
current values by default. I've tested with 0.2/0.5 type values
and noticed a greatly improved response and better scattering of
nodetimers, as well as enjoying not faceplanting into doors with
pressure plates anymore.

This adds a simple, and small 'North' indicator to the circular
minimap. The indicator is in a classical triangle-like arrow with a
little bit of shading to accentuate the shape and give it a little
bit depth. The indicator is stuck exactly at the edge as far outwards
as possible, and is not too intrusive but still easy enough to spot.

This took me a while to figure out. We no longer visit all 9 block
around and with the touched node, but instead visit adjacent plus
self. We then walk -non- recursively through all neigbors and if
they cause a nodeupdate, we just keep walking until it ends. On
the way back we prune the tail.

I've tested this with 8000+ sand nodes. Video result is here:

Took ~ 10 seconds to process and return to normal.

@SmallJoker has noted a bug that servers from the (local) main menu
favorites list can't be opened.

This commit fixes the bug by disabling any main menu based protocol
checks for servers from the favorite list.

Also, it fixes a second bug that happens when a server from the
public serverlist doesn't send its supported protocol versions,
most likely because its running a minetest older than commit [1].
Then we have shown an error msg that the server has enforced
one specific protocol version. This was most likely not the case.

Of course, we can't do anything better than do an assumption on
the protocol versions if they are not known. That assumption
should however be closest to the most often occuring case as
possible.

Also, some little cleanups.

There is no need to put them into the header, they are solely used

Another advantage of this change is that only the pathfinder.cpp has
to be compiled if PATHFINDER_DEBUG gets defined or undefined, not
all files including the .h.

This commit moves the pathfinder classes to the cpp file without
modifications.
Also, the PATHFINDER_DEBUG macro gets moved to the cpp file and
the PATHFINDER_CALC_TIME macro gets moved to a plce where it
actually does work.

Before, the GridNodes were stored in vector<vector<vector<T>>>,
and initialized in advance. Putting three vectors inside each other
puts lots of unneccessary stress onto the allocator, costs more memory,
and has worse cache locality than a flat vector<T>.

For larger search distances, an the array getting initialized means
essentially O(distance^3) complexity in both time and memory,
which makes the current path search a joke. In order to really
profit from the dijkstra/A* algorithms, other data structures
need to be used for larger distances.

For shorter distances, a map based GridNode storage may be slow as
it requires lots of levels of indirection, which is bad for things like
cache locality, and an array based storage may be faster.

This commit does:

1. remove the vector<vector<vector<T>>> based GridNodes storage that
is allocated and initialized in advance and for the whole
possible area.

2. Add a vector<T> based GridNodes storage that is allocated and
initialized in advance for the whole possible area.

3. Add a map<P,T> based GridNodes storage whose elements are
allocated and initialized, when the path search code
demands it.

4. Add code to decide between approach 2 and 3,
based on the length of the path.

5. Remove the unused 'surfaces' member of the PathGridnode class.
Setting this isn't as easy anymore for the
map based GridNodes storage.

"aa8c88cf4a61362ada473fc058fbfb50aa235d23","2016-04-25 17:14:57-07:00","find_path: consider walkable instead of CONTENT_AIR

The path finding code works fairly well except that it considers
anythin not CONTENT_AIR to be 'above the surface'. This results in
paths that are unwalkable for entities since e.g. plants are not
walkable. The path would force them to jump on top of grass plants,
etc..

The obvious solution is not to use CONTENT_AIR as a criteria, but
instead distinguish between walkable and non-walkable nodes. This
results in paths that properly walk through grass nodes.

This was extensively tested by a flock of electric sheep.

Note that for underwater purposes this changes the behaviour from
'the surface is walkable' to 'ignore water entirely' making the
path go across the water bottom, and pathing fail likely from the
water surface. This is intentional.

Fixes #2122
Fixes #1454

Addendum (est31)
According from its docs in android_native_app_glue.h (from the NDK), the
onInputEvent should 'Return 1 if you have handled the event, 0 for any
default dispatching'. Before, we always returned 1, meaning we blocked
all hardware keys to be given to the OS.
This broke the volume keys and has caused #2122 and #1454.

Although it bases on lots of guesswork, it can probably safely be said that
CGUIEnvironment::postEventFromUser returns true if the event was handled,
and false if not. Therefore, set the status variable depending on what
postEventFromUser returned.
