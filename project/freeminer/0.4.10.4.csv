This reverts commit 5b518ed2feff28c9bf21ad940c1b211b72d71bd1.

This caused duplicate tracebacks and tracebacks when unwanted.
It also ignored the level argument to error() and didn't pass the message (or level) to debug.traceback().
Use xpcall() or lua_pcall()'s errorhandler argument instead.

This makes a number of changes:
* Remove the dependency on marshal by using string.dump and loadstring.
* Use lua_tolstring rather than having Lua functions pass string lengths to C++.
* Move lua_api/l_async_events.* to cpp_api/s_async.*, where it belongs.
* Make AsyncWorkerThread a child of ScriptApiBase, this removes some duplicate functionality.
* Don't wait for async threads to shut down.  (Is this safe?  Might result in corruption if the thread is writing to a file.)
* Pop more unused items from the stack
* Code style fixes
* Other misc changes

See: https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/1525

Background
Wuzzy2: If you attempt to spawn a L-system tree with minetest.spawn_tree, you can make Minetest crash if it is attempted to pop an empty stack.

ShadowNinja: This shouldn't cause a segmentation fault, but it should throw a Lua error

Commit Description
This commit throws a Lua error instead of causing a segmentation fault. The server will still 'crash' but will include a Lua backtrace.

L-Systems fix randomness
Unless a random seed is provided (via Lua treedef) seed the PRNG with a different seed for each tree
Resolves: https://github.com/minetest/minetest/issues/1469

Fix l-system crash when treedef random_level not set by Lua

So I was checking out minetest and wondered how many developers there are
and how they development community is setup and such, so I decided to have
a look at the git shortlog. There were lot of double entries for some
persons, so it was harder to estimate the number of people involved.

By adding a .mailmap file, the overview of the authors is much improved
For details on the .mailmap file, see

Revert 'Remove m_ext_ptr in GUIFormSpecMenu, replaced by refcount mechanism'

This reverts commit b49e5cfc7013cef7e9af79d17e04f7e7e4c377d4.

Basic reformatting with astyle
-- additional formatting will be modified, manually, as the need for it is encountered

Start 'outlining' what a MinetestApp class might look like

Add MinetestApp::shutdown()

Converted class member functions to camelCase and created protos for new functions

First stage of connect to server done

Add get itemdefs/nodedefs/media code

Init clouds, camera, sky, init GUI, HUD

Input handling

Client events, camera, sound, draw

Fix wield hand getting stuck digging and add debug text back

Fix FPS

Added profiler graph back

Fix FPS issue
Need to work out what went wrong and clean up the copy/paste stuff

Annotate

Various:
Rewrote limitFps()
Limited scope of some variables

Jitter calcs

Reduce scope of objects

Move some stuff out of ::run and minor formatting cleanup

Scope reduction

Function splits

Removed old (broken) limitFps()

Added exception handling back

Fixed some formatting

Reverted commented out unit tests (uncommented them)

Slow clouds down on loading and media screens so the behaviour is like the original the_game()

Formatting/style (no functional changes)

Manually reapply upstream b49e5cf: Remove m_ext_ptr in GUIFormSpecMenu, replaced by refcount mechanism

Fixed silly errors on my part
Minor formatting cleanups

Removed strange differentiation in FPS limiting when loading
FPS limiting was done differently if cloud_menu_background was true, which does not make sense

Cleaning up

f7d6509 introduces error when no endian.h found in the system.

Since 'CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE' returns empty string instead of '0', when
'cmake_config.h' is generated it has '#define CMAKE_HAVE_ENDIAN_H ' line.
Later we have '#define HAVE_ENDIAN_H CMAKE_HAVE_ENDIAN_H' in the
'config.h', an thus 'HAVE_ENDIAN_H' is also empty sting. Because of
this, '#if HAVE_ENDIAN_H' is incorrect preprocessor directive.
