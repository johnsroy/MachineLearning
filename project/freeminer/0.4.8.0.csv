Completely rewrote the liquid transformation. The algorithm now exclusively modifies the current node in one iteration. Another change is that MapNode.param2 now stores a bit that tells other nodes if a flowing liquid node flows downwards. This is accomplished by two masks on param2 for the 'flow down' bit and the 'liquid level' bits.

This will be the base of future improvements to the liquid flow. However, in the current state flowing liquid does not always disappear when cut off its source. Be aware that this branch is work in progress.

This solves two issues at once:
* CMake would delete po files during ‘make clean’ because it thought
they were autogenerated and not just managed
* the only gettext tools readily available in Windows are so old they
don't support options like --package-name

The change also moves minetest.pot down one level, so we don't need to
special case ‘en’ anymore.

The downside is of course that you need some sane POSIX shell to update
the po files.

This one contains these changes from main c55:
* Adds a function to check if there is room for a specific item
* Using that, you can now pick up rats if you have a full inventory and a not full rat stack
* Furnace would cook only 1 item if that item used the last available result slot, now it will continue
* Furnace will say it's overloaded
* Furnace won't wait until the next step to start on the next item
- This caused small fuels to cook slower than meant to
- Also caused furnaces to say they were out of fuel after finishing the last fuel item

Opaque water's solidness was being set to 2, like a normal node.
When you swim, it is treated like a solid block, and the display
goes black.  Setting it to 1 like transparent water allows you to
see.

It looks somewhat awkward when you swim, look up, and see an opaque
wall of water (the surface), but there isn't much that can be done
about it.  If you made the water transparent so it looked good,
it would defeat the purpose :) .

Finish fixing the material color code. But it won't work until MineTest has dynamic lighting... another day another feature.

Extra checks for the bone positioning / rotation code

Many checks and consistency improvements to the client attachment code

Make a separate function for checking if a client object is attached. A more in-depth change will be needed here to fix reading of invalid pointers

Use a different method of fetching the parent. Fixes the mass segmentation faults when rendering an attachment (some still happen though)

Major change to how attachments are handled. Fix the last segmentaton fault, which was due to the parent becoming invalid while being refreshed / removed which would bause the child to remain attached to nothing. Parents remove their children when being deleted themselves and add them back when re-added. Attachments are stored inside a 2D a vector which easily allows both a child to find their parent and a parent to find its children.

Remove attachment list entry when an object is being permanently removed. Also avoid duplicate entries in this list when re-attaching the same object

Fix the last segmentation fault (apparently). So far attachments seem to be fully functional, although removing the parent causes children to go to origin 0,0,0 and possibly still cause such a fault (though this should already be addressed)

Fix a bug in falling code where entities get stuck

Also check if the parent has been removed server-side, and detach the child if so. Fixes children going to origin 0,0,0 when their parent is removed.

Unset all attachment properties when permanently detaching (on both the client and server). Also store less data we don't need

Create a separate function for detaching, and also update lua api documentation

When a child is detached, update its position from the server to clients. This WILL cause it to get positioned slightly differently client side, as the server attachment system only copies parent origin and knows not about mesh / bone transformation. This prevents different clients seeing the object detached in different spots which is most correct

Update the position of attached players to clients. An attached player will see himself move, but this is currently VERY ugly and laggy as it is done by the server (it probably must stay this way too)

Use a different approach for locally attached players. This allows for smooth positio transitions to work, as well at the player turning around freely. Still buggy however

the world.mt file. mods are disabled by a setting of the form
'load_mod_<modname> = false'. if no load_mod_<modname> = ... setting

question mark for 'new' mods

Mods can be enabled/disabled by a checkbox. Mods also show a list of
dependencies and reverse dependencies. double-click on a mod in
dependency or reverse dependency listbox selects the corresponding
mod. Enabling a mod also enables all its dependencies. Disabling a mod
also disables all its reverse dependencies.

For modpacks, show buttons to enable/disable all mods (recursively,
including their dependencies) in it.

returns to the main menu. Button 'Cancel' returns to main menu without
saving.

All uses of operator[] in guiConfigureWorld.cpp have been replaced
with .find() operations.

In some places, operator[] had been called with mod names of 'Add-Ons'
or 'N/A', which would insert a default-constructed ModSpec into the
list of add-on mods. In other places, the use of operator[] was safe
now, but it probably is safer for future changes to use .find()
everywhere.

the following:
1. String concatenation in guiMainMenu.cpp - it is required for all
individual strings to be of the same type <unicode/non-unicode>; adding
explicit L qualifier before the other strings.
2. Correcting type of BlockMakeData to struct in place of class forward
declarations. This information is used for name decoration by Visual
Studio, leading to linker errors in case of mismatches.
3. Windows headers define max as a macro somewhere, leading to a compile
time error in profiler.h; using () around function to prevent macro match
from occurring.

When first entering an area, sometimes placing nodes replaces other nodes that are not buildable_to. This seems to be caused by the fact that nodes in unloaded map blocks are treated as ignore, a node that is buildable_to. This fixes that, by using get_node_or_nil() instead of the previously-used get_node(), then checking to see if the nodes were actually loaded before replacing.

TextureSource has a list of textures to delete (m_texture_trash) so this
provides a proper, non-hacky way to delete RTT textures. Also, the prior,
hacky way of deleting them seems to be broken (see pull request #803).

To avoid header file clutter by repeating the same long list of
arguments over and over again, store the arguments of
generateTextureFromMesh in a struct called TextureFromMeshParams.

Also fix issue #782 (Only use bilinear (and others) on item textures
when settings allow it).
