By adding these extra tests, I managed to find why the algorithm
sometimes added 1 line too many, so I was able to remove the
work-around of always having 1 blank line at the bottom.

This means more efficient usage of screen page when pagenumbers
are turned off.

This fixes #281 where some users got confused because they only saw 20 books after scanning. There is no real reason to limit the amount of results anyway, since we use Cursors for the results.

This text is rendered on the UI thread, and the only place it
could get images from is a http address. Since we don't want to
allow that, we disable images alltogether.

I've created an issue to add a nice message for 2.1, but since that
requires translations I've opted to just show an empty list for now.

This is a fix for #299 where too much white space was used at the bottom

space used by the page number.

this.
