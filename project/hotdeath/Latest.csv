- allow rotation of display
- allow for installation on SD card for Froyo and up
- center of the table will look a little different in smallish landscape displays
like a phone in landscape (put the current player/color/direction indicator to the
right of the discard pile instead of beneath it)
- removed 'standard rules' to avoid copyright issues
- card graphics revamped to avoid copyright issues
- hand sorting: when in face up mode, sort all cards together (cards still are flagged
as face up or face down even in this mode, and the system was sorting them separately)
- AI improvements:
- added color balance awareness; the more aggressive the player, the longer
he is willing to try to preserve a nice even color balance in his hand
- smarter play of the MAD card -- don't dump it if you're holding a ton of points
- smarter play of the 69 card -- sometimes the 69 card keeps your score much
lower (if you have hundreds of other points in your hand, it's a good card
to keep)
- smarter play of the Mystery Draw -- try to throw it only on numbered cards,
with higher preference toward higher numbers, and special consideration of
the 69 card
- bugfix: at the end of a round, hit 'Back', 'Continue', 'Back' -- crash
- bugfix: if computer player went out on a Wild card, he wouldn't pick a color,
and bad things would happen...

- bugfix: upon getting all bastard cards in hand, entire game would end; should have
just ended the round and given 0 points to the lucky player
http://code.google.com/p/hotdeath/issues/detail?id=1

- bugfix: previously, we required that you have the Quitter, Big Brother, and Retaliation
at the end of a hand for the 1,000 point penalty; after some extensive research online,
I believe that should only be the Quitter and the Retaliation

- improved card docs so that all bastard cards' help contains the bastard card
