Following Sean Owen's suggestions, I cleaned up my code in the Aztec

2. Replaced my own assertEqualByteArrays() with existing
assertArrayEquals().
3. Replaced C-style array declarations with more Javaish ones.

* Fixed bug #593

Bug #593 was misleadingly reported as pertaining to another project, but
testing revealed it affected this project as well.  The Code128 encoding
algorithm failed when an odd number of digits were followed by FNC1 and
other digits.  The code selection algorithm was rewritten.  A test case
showing the bug was added, and an old test case was updated to expect
the result of the new algorithm  -  another valid encoding of the same
length as the old one.

* Further cleanup of Code128 writer test

Removed a private one-liner method used exactly once, alphabetized

* Simplify conversion RGB -> luminance

Removed testing every pixel for greyness in RGBLuminanceSource, as it
did not appreciably change the speed of converting a greyscale image and
slowed down the conversion of a colour image by a few percent.  Besides,
there was no need to treat every row separately; the total number of
pixels was enough.

* Minor improvements to BitArray

Simplified some code, added more accurate error checking, and corrected
small inaccuracies in comments.
