This allows page titles with HTML entities like `&amp;` to display
properly. Before, no decoding would be performed and `&amp;` would be
shown where an ampersand should be. Additionally, decoding entities
prevents the following string length check from overcounting.

To replicate this bug scan an image with a URL pointing to
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android The title displayed
within the app will be something like:
`Frequent &#39;android&#39; Questions - Stack Overflow` After this
commit, the app will display the correct decoded title:
`Frequent 'android' Questions - Stack Overflow`
