Changed the project names for the two Android clients to disambiguate them.
........
r332 | dswitkin | 2008-04-01 09:11:36 -0700 (Tue, 01 Apr 2008) | 1 line

Added some debugging features to the M3 Android client. You can now press 'C' to capture a photo, 'U' to decode only UPC/1D barcodes, and 'Q' to decode only QR Codes.
........
r334 | dswitkin | 2008-04-01 12:23:05 -0700 (Tue, 01 Apr 2008) | 1 line

Added latency measurement in milliseconds to the Android client.
........

Improved the Android M3 viewfinder display, by making the framing box larger and zooming in. Also fixed a bug when restarting the activity where the camera params were stale. Fixed handling of geo and tel URIs.
........
r343 | srowen | 2008-04-03 15:18:16 -0700 (Thu, 03 Apr 2008) | 1 line

Moved the 'geo:' fix to the 'right' place
........
r352 | dswitkin | 2008-04-08 08:25:13 -0700 (Tue, 08 Apr 2008) | 1 line

Rewrote the Android M3 client to do continuous decoding, which means you no longer have to push the shutter button. Now you can just place the barcode in the viewfinder and it will display the contents as soon as it decodes them. That also means you no longer get 'barcode not found' error dialogs which is a big improvement. Also made sure that capturing debug JPEGs uses unique filenames.
........
r353 | dswitkin | 2008-04-08 09:06:13 -0700 (Tue, 08 Apr 2008) | 1 line

Improved the CameraThread state machine, and fixed a bug where preview would not continue after capture.
........

Made sure the BitmapSource subclasses do not reuse a BitArray which is too small.
........
r356 | dswitkin | 2008-04-11 12:30:54 -0700 (Fri, 11 Apr 2008) | 1 line

Changed ProGuard settings so it will inline methods which use private members. This eliminates tens of thousands of function calls to BitArray.get() on a typical decode, and lots of other work as well. Overall we're roughly 20% faster by using ProGuard than turning it off.
........
r357 | dswitkin | 2008-04-11 13:25:09 -0700 (Fri, 11 Apr 2008) | 1 line

Made the worker threads shut down synchronously to fix a race condition where the CameraManager could close the camera driver too soon.
........
r358 | dswitkin | 2008-04-11 14:16:08 -0700 (Fri, 11 Apr 2008) | 1 line

Added 'T' as a shortcut to toggle debug method tracing using android.os.Debug and traceview for analysis. The traces are written to /sdcard, which means the SD Card must not be mounted as a volume by USB at the time. Tracing can slow down decoding by a factor of 5 or more but gives very useful insights into where the time is going.
........
r361 | dswitkin | 2008-04-15 15:34:49 -0700 (Tue, 15 Apr 2008) | 1 line

A couple small improvements to the CameraManager.

Fix Issue 50, not building on Windows, by adding some small workarounds for Windows paths in build files for Android
........
r365 | dswitkin | 2008-04-17 13:09:17 -0700 (Thu, 17 Apr 2008) | 1 line

Converted the Android client to use a status bar on the bottom of the screen instead of dialogs for a much better, less interrupting user experience.
........
r372 | dswitkin | 2008-04-21 11:11:02 -0700 (Mon, 21 Apr 2008) | 1 line

Added some simple sharpening for 1D decoding which allowed a couple more blackbox images to pass. There were a few cases where the format or content is now misdetected, but since the net gain was positive I decided to make those non-fatal errors. In real world use the sharpening seems to help, and I think we can do even better with a better algorithm.

it into the detailed format the iPhone's Address Book API wants, we punt a bit
and instead just break it into multiple pieces, each on a separate line, and
store that as the 'street' part of the 'Home' address for the contact we're
creating. That way, at least the information is captured rather than lost, and
the user can sync it to their computer, copy-and-paste it into the appropriate
fields, and then sync it back to the iPhone. Not idea, but better than
nothing, which is what we had before.

- Created Java files with our headers, packages, etc.
- Converted includes to imports, or commented out the unresolved dependencies
- Merged all the .h and .cpp contents into Java classes
- Fixed most of the formatting
- Did all the simple transformations (bool, NULL, const, struct, string, ::, ->)
- Created a Debug class to handle all the asserts and logging
- Fixed about half of the static arrays
- Removed some pthread cruft

IMPORTANT:

- Please do not start hacking this code up as I'm going to keep making large changes to it. In particular, we need to leave the trailing underscores on member variables for now. Once everything is compiling with no errors, we can revisit stylistic issues.
- There will be a number of similar classes within the encoder and in the rest of ZXing. We should refactor those later (BitVector and BitArray come to mind). In the mean time, I want to get everything working and the tests passing before we do that.

The unit tests pass and I believe the change is complete, but there are some clients like J2ME and Bug that I can't build.

This change will allow new thresholding algorithms to be developed and tested, as well as implemented per platform if needed (e.g. in JNI on Android). It should also perform better when multiple 2D Readers are installed, because the underlying image will only be converted to 1 bit once. It also allows some platforms to return luminance data without a copy.

The current state of this checkin is to use the old black point algorithm, which now lives in GlobalHistogramBinarizer. This will be our benchmark and fallback for slower platforms. Going forward we will begin to use LocalBlockBinarizer as I shake out the edge cases and tune it for performance. Currently it is unused.

IMPORTANT: I have temporarily included three methods from MonochromeBitmapSource at the end of BinaryBitmap as a way to make this change in stages. They are deprecated and will be removed soon. All of the Reader classes will need to change the way they examine 1 bit pixels to use the new getBlackRow() and getBlackMatrix() calls.

- Refactoring:
- All the files are now in a zxing folder,
- Changed the namespaces so that everything is either in zxing or
zxing::qrcode.
- Moved most function implementations from the headers to source
files.
- Ported the new design from the Java code with LuminanceSource,
BinaryBitmap, Binarizer, GlobalHistogramBinarizer and
LocalBlockBinarizer.
- Fixed two rare segmentation faults: one in
GridSampler::checkAndNudgePoints, and one in
ReedSolomonDecoder::decode. These would simply cause
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions in Java, but have to be checked
explicitly in C++.
- With help from Erno Mäkinen, used std::vector instead of ArrayRef in
many places, as ArrayRef causes problems on Symbian phones.
- Added scons build files.
- Added a test application using ImageMagick.
- More small changes.

It uses the old histogram for 1D and the new approach for 2D. The unit tests don't fully demonstrate how much better this is in real-world lighting, but it pretty much solves the situation of pointing at a QR Code for 30 seconds without scanning, due to a shadow or gradient.

HybridBinarizer is now the default across all the fast clients and the unit tests.

This provide C++ support for Hanzi from issue 582. With it the C++
qrcode blackbox test results again match the Java results.

The changes are mostly a re-port of various pieces of the Java code
for supporting modes and bit stream parsing in QR codes. It expands
the modes/parsing including ECI and FNC, refactors StringUtils as was
done in Java, and makes DecoderResult include the fields that the Java
code has.

Although the non-qrcode blackbox tests don't all match the Java code
(a known issue) the entire blackbox suite was run under valgrind and
has no errors, including invalid memory references and leaks.

This commit also includes a few cleanups for things like files that
had mixed line endings, i.e., a combination of LF and CR-LF.

This is mostly just inlining a couple of getter/setter pairs that are in the tightest loops.
The only semantic change is making the retain() and release() methods of the reference counted
objects non-virtual, which allows them to be inlined.

- I tweaked the SConscript to be a little happier with OS X and cppunit and imagemagick
in /opt/local.  These should be benign on other systems but let me know if they aren't
and I'll back tweak them or back them out.

approach is to stop testing for min/max values once the dynamic range

A bunch of small changes that result in C++ and Java equiv. for pdf417.

- A little bit of java re-reporting in pdf417
- A little bit of java re-reporting/consistency elsewhere

There a few places related to latching that differed between the java
and C++. I looked for a discussion of this on the group and didn't find
any (but may have missed it.) I reverted to the java code which fixed
one of the tests. The comments referenced standards-compliance vs. real
world encoders. That may need to be revisited?
