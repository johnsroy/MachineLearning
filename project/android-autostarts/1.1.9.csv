I'm normally not a fan about supporting different orientations if there is no good reason for it (like the necessity to use a keyboard), but since our app is so simple, and the orientation change is so fast, it makes sense to implement this; besides, we now also better support other configuration changes. Note though that currently, there is still a bug when changing while a component state change is ongoing.
