classes (I think) and referenced using a dollar sign (like so:
'com.package.name$class'). Because I was not escaping the
package/receiver name when running the command, the shell considered the
class name a variable and expanded it. Not only is this a terrible noob
mistake, it's outright dangerous.

Many thanks to Dan Feigt for reporting the bug.
