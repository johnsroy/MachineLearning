"8051ec4e7ebf7353288ff13ad212837a876af6e4","2009-07-05 20:59:58+02:00","Upon investigation, it turns out there are no good locale Broadcasts to handle. The only one that exists (and which is apparently undocumented), will only be handled by locale itself, while the one that would really be interesting, sent out by locale, is designed in a way to let the plugin choose a custom action. So as long as we're restricted to the current way of querying receivers, there is nothing to do here.
