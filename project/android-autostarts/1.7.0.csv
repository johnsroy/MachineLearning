root. Use WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS when available to auto-manage the 'ADB
Debugging' settings.

Many users are confused about the requirement to enable ADB debugging.
The initial message instructing the user to enable it doesn't seem to be
enough. It's also a problem in that it can be a security liablity. I
have a variety of ideas to improve this situation, and this is the first
change in that regard.

If we're signed with a system certificate, we can use
setComponentEnabledState() rather than going the root-route. If we're
installed on the system partition, we can auto-enable the ADB Debugging
setting.

changing the component state, even with our timeout (in that it didn't
do it's job: the su-process still hang, and this was only fixed by a
device reboot).

I can no longer reproduce the problem.

So I'm adding another timeout, *before* the su-call this time, hoping
for some extra safety.

While we shouldn't really need the timeout anymore with ADB being
enabled by us automatically, there are still those rarse cases where we
see problems (as described in e9e7a203e97a24d7b8b4077a903542455fa19986,
for example). Using a timeout in all cases ensures that the user
experience in case there are problems isn't impacted too much.

It might be helpful though to indicate to the user somehow that a
timeout is employed, and that potentially it should be investigated why
that happens.

that using the NO_RESTART flag isn't worth it. The documentation warns
about potentially causing issues with the running package, and while I
judge the danger to be smaller, potentially causing a lot of issues and

would have been a custom icon based on the Browser's ic_menu_list, with
reduced width for the lower bars (indicating a child item), and 180Â°
rotation, so that the darkest item is on the top. It would be similar to
the 'Sort A-Z' icon in the system 'Manage Applications' activity, but
with only two different item lengths.
