When Home starts for the first time, it spawns a loading thread for the workspace items. That loader is responsible for starting the drawer loader after it's done. Unfortunately, after a wipe data or a database upgrade, the worksapce loader could be interrupted by a ContentProvider notification change which would cause the loader to be cancelled and another workspace loader to be spawned. The new workspace loader, however, would not start the drawer loader because the appropriate flag was not set correctly.

During the first boot upgrade, LauncherProvider will deleteHost() to clear out any old appWidgetId bindings.  During the first boot, Launcher calls AppWidgetHost.startListening() to watch for widget updates.  It also calls loadUserItems(), which loads data from LauncherProvider, triggering the database creation and deleteHost() call.  Because deleteHost() removes any existing callbacks, any future widget updates are dropped on the floor.  (This can currently be solved by rebooting, because there isn't an upgrade on subsequent boots.)
This bug was particularly evident on vfpioneer-userdebug builds, as there aren't any configuration changes that cause Launcher to be destroyed and recreated.  (When destroyed and recreated, we startListening() again, and LauncherProvider doesn't call deleteHost().)
To handle this special case, Launcher creates a ContentObserver pointing at a specific URI, which the LauncherProvider notifies when the AppWidgetHost is reset through deleteHost(), allowing Launcher to correctly startListening() again.

This change adds nearby-area searching when dragging desktop items into already-occupied cells.  This approach tries harder to find a matching area, instead of strictly rejecting invalid moves.

We also draw a 'snag' during the drag to show where an item would be dropped, but only if we would drop into an alternative cell.  This gives users better feedback about where things will drop.

loadApplications and stopAndWaitForApplicationsLoader are synchronized,
and ApplicationsLoader::run synchronizes with LauncherModel, causing
a deadlock.

(The problem was exposed by removing the timeout from the thread joins.
Previously, it would deadlock for five seconds, then time out and march
on blindly.  This means that compared to CM5.0.7 before the disappearing
icons fix, this should fix some random 5-second stalls in the launcher.)

Remove the synchronize.  Even if mStopped is set to true after the conditional,
we still have, in fact, successfully loaded applications, so it's perfectly
valid to set mApplicationsLoaded.  The only caveat is that other threads can
only safely set mApplicationsLoaded back to false if the thread isn't running.

This means that abortLoaders shouldn't be setting mApplicationsLoaded = false,
because it doesn't end the thread; it just asynchronously asks the thread to
exit and then continues without waiting.  Leave it to the thread, when it
finally exits, to set mApplicationsLoaded correctly.

Note that loadApplications also sets mApplicationsLoaded = false.  That's correct
(though probably redundant); the thread is never running here (we just called
stopAndWaitForApplicationsLoader), and this is explicitly clearing the app cache
to reload it.

This has a side-effect: previously, abortLoaders had the unobvious side-effect
of clearing the app cache (clearing mApplicationsLoaded).  That no longer happens.
This function is only used by Launcher on shutdown anyway.

Not sure yet about possible side-effects of doing this, but launcher uses the recursive function EVERY time you press MENU, EVERY time you start dragging a desktop item, EVERY time you long press an empty desktop area.... so i prefer to have a responsive desktop even if it means sometimes have to manually 'unoverlap' a widget

First one is a (one mor time) try-catch, cause sometimes some widgets throws an illegalargumentexception on the saved state when rotating the phone. I don't have more hints about specific steps/widgets to further test.
The second fix is a proper 'kill' to the Launcher activity (same as the settings one).
I noticed with the previous method, that widgets stopped updating until a rotate/restart of the activity. With this kill widgets are working allright, though the restart requieres a few seconds more than previous one...

And as those devices can perform pretty well without cache... let's add an option... one more...

Enabled by default too the scrolllable widget support, now it performs way better. But disabled the event broadcasting for the 'animated widgets', cause we'ra not using them atm and needs code revisions.

Added the preferences ui to pick and apply themes, and added themable support
for a lot of things.
I'm completely sure i could refactor the code so it can be all managed inside
a custom class instead all over the other files...

As stated in my code's comment, each LiveWallpaper needs to support the 'hide' and 'show' commands for it to work,
we're just trying to play nice with LWP devs by asking them to hide the LWP (or pause, or whatever they want)
but they need to react to our command.

Seems my Viewstub borked the old xml nextFocus properties somewhat, so I've ended up changing
the nextFocus ids in code depending the screen orientation and the app drawer status.

I don't think it's a good idea allowing the LAB/RAB/LAB2/RAB2 buttons to be added to this fix,
the app drawer should maintain the focus only to/from the apps button...
