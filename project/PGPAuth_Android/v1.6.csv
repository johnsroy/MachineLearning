- Added option to force APG instead of OpenKeychain. OpenKeychain is prefered when installed.
- Logic has a static member Logic set by the main-view after initializing the logic-class
- activity_main now has a ListView instead of the two buttons
- Serverlist is working with custom adapter

Not a working version as the servers are currently hard-coded.

There are three things to do until the next release:
- move all strings to the resource files
- fix a bug where the app hangs when OpenKeychain wants the password for the key (working fine when the password is cached)
- decide on a version number. seems like a big change for a 1.6 ;)

Also:
- Moved all strings to the resources and deleted values-en, as this is the default language.
- Removed the old app-global settings for the server.
