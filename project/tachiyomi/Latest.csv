This typically happens when a manga is pulled from their catalog (I tested it on Nisekoi). Previous behavior led to a NullPointerError, now gives an empty page list.

Giving a reason to the user beyond 'Empty Page list' would be a good idea in the future (this seems to be one holdup for #220), but there doesn't seem to be an obvious place to put it without touching the base classes.  In the meantime, this is far more informative than null errors.
