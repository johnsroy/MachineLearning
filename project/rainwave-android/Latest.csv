Version 1.2.0

This will be the final feature release of Rainwave for Android, and the change
in the minor version is just an indicator of the deprecation.

New this version:

* Corrections to Spanish translation.
* Fix crashes when requesting tracks by artist (issue #49).
* Some internal code cleanup, and logging improvements.
