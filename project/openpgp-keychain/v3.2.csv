When importing lots of keys, lots of messages about the status of keys
is generated, including some debug slime and general fluff that
isn't really needed a lot of the time. As a result, a serious bug can come
along after key imports or certain operations which cause a log to become
parceled.

This commit implements a pool to 'dehydrate' logs into: they are placed
into the pool (a ConcurrentHashMap) and a UUID assigned to them, which
is parceled along. When the OperationResult is un-parceled, it reads in
the appropriate UUID bits and rehydrates the appropriate log.

In order to avoid any memory leaks, the log pool removes a reference to
the log itself, allowing the log to die a natural death at the hands
of the GC..

The App crashed because the Adapter was trying to call a method on a
null object.

Where was the null object?
CheckBox was null because in the Layout file
view_key_adv_user_id_item.xml

There is no such widget with id = user_id_item_check_box

Fix :
I removed the two lines which were causing the bug, and now the screen
loads perfectly.

For an unknown key, there is no indication of the state the key is in.
To indicate both immediate action required, and to make this status
equal to its worst case (rather than *better* than its worst case), the
status is displayed in red.

At some point, we will probably want to download unknown keys
automatically, at which point an unknown key will actually be an error
state. This is an intermediate solution until then.
