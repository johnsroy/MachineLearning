PanicKit provides a common framework for creating 'panic button' apps that
can trigger actions in 'panic responder' apps.  In this case, the response
is to clear all the cached passphrases.

Unlike UID revocations which are 'reversible' by newer UID
self-signatures, a subkey revocation should be 'permanent' even if
followed by a newer self-signature.

The RFC is ambiguous on this, but this is the convention used by (e.g.)
GnuPG. The rationale for this behaviour is available as comments within
the GnuPG source.

UID signatures:
