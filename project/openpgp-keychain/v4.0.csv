Approach:
Find the first unstripped secret key and use it for passphrase verification
All unstripped keys will have their passphrase changed to new passphrase, if possible.

Current Progress:
Changing the passphrase of keys works fine.
Refactoring to combine 'modifySecretKeyring' and newly added method, 'modifyKeyRingPassword'
may be possible if given the go-ahead.
