specifics:
- secret keys are preserved when a new public key is inserted
- started work to give virtual columns a representation in the contract
class
- streamline ProviderHelper methods. the getUnifiedData method relies
on a api level 11 method, not sure yet how to fix/workaround that...
- many more small things work as they did before

GnuPG doesn't support expiry of user id certifications. The number
of rings with an expiration subpacket in a cert out there is likely
negligible.

ViewCertActivity now verifies the key and displays a status. For
revocation certs, the revocation reason is also shown.
