"d93b6c7fe6f336aeff59f0bbeb72b6c51f06df6e","2014-07-26 13:57:24+02:00","Introduced gestures.

It is now possible to use a fling, a long press and so on to trigger
actions on the whole list, like checking everything or discarding
checked items. A contextual actions menu can also be open on gesture.

As a consequence, the option menu is simplified. All those actions are
replaced by a unique entry which opens the contextual actions menu.
