Previously, this code was only consuming the key up events.
This fixes https://github.com/SufficientlySecure/document-viewer/issues/128  (tested on my Nexus 4 running Android 5.1.1); now the system volume control UI no longer appears when I use the volume buttons to flip pages.

TODO: For the scroll up/down keybindings, it would be better if the scrolling continued as long as you held the buttons down, instead of just scrolling once upon releasing the button.
