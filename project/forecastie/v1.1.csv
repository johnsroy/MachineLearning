The previous solution was bad because of the following aspects:
- Extending the Application class is not recommended, as it often is not required, like in this case
- The android system is allowed to remove apps to save memory and battery. Once done, the widget won't update the time anymore until the application is re-opened by the user (or possibly our background weather service)
- Furthermore, the handler kept the application alive, consuming more battery than required, especially if actually no time widget is used by the user

Instead, using an alarm receiver to schedule updates to an app that might not be running all the time is the recommended way

Only update if last check is longer ago than a specified threshold (currently 5 minutes).

It can be annoying that weather is always reloaded on main activity resume, even if the activity was only away for a few seconds (e.g. after changing some settings); and also consume mobile data more than necessary, as weather won't change every few minutes. Users can still manually reload if necessary.
