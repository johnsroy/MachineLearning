When a bookmark is updated now, the content provider triggers an upload only sync that syncs any pending changes to Pinboard.  This should result in more predictable operation during limited connectivity and low memory situations (issue that prompted change was for user who's bookmarks would not always save because the os would kill PinDroid too quickly after sharing a bookmark, which would kill the running async task as well).
