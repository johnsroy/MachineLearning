- Warning: not feature complete yet (default profile creation in
particular is missing).
- New tutorial pages using standalones classes: TutorialIntroFragment,
TutorialSetupFragment.
- Intro is meant as a quick introduction on how to use the app,
including a simple animation.
- Setup is meant to replace the default profile dialog. That is,
default profile creation will be handled in the last page of the
tutorial.
- TutorialActivity has been short-circuited to show only these three
pages. However, no further code has been removed, and some
functionality is still missing.
