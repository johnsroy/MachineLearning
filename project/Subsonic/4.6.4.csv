Samsung devices require that a song be in the PAUSED state for the Bluetooth metadata to be updated properly.  It seems to be causing issues with other devices (ie: LG G2): http://forum.subsonic.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=14338

Subsonic maintains two separate directories: one for music and one for artwork, playlists, etc to be stored.  The .nomedia needs to still be in the home folder so that the playlists don't show up, but it is also needed in the music folder to hide those as well.

checkDownloads is no longer called in a loop, which was how the queue got filled after clearing and refreshing the shuffle buffer.  Fix was to add a delayed call which calls checkDownloads after a refill action occurs.
