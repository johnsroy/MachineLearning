In offline mode, playlists are read from a .m3u file which stores the absolute paths.  No matter what, the files need to be passed to createEntry without the .complete part in the filename or else the files will not be found.  If the normal name file does not exist, need to check against the .complete one as well before removing it from the list of valid songs to show in the playlist.

For audio books we want to modify the automatic creation of deletion of bookmarks.  An example of what this is supposed to handle:

Start in chapter 8 from bookmark, continue to chapter to 9 of 10.  At position 8:50 of 10:00.  Start playing some music.  Current behavior is that this will have deleted a bookmark from 8 and not create one at 9.  Now, it will create one at 9 since there is still another chapter to read.
