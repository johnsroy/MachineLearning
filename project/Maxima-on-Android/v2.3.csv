qepmax is updated to the latest.
defrule part of qepmax did not work due to issues on apply1, apply2,
applyb1, applyb2. This issue is fixed. Now rational coefficients and
rational functions are treated perfectly.
Nested call to qe() is fully supported.
Automatic call to ReadQepcad() is removed and now qe() works quite the
same way as on Linux/Mac OS X.
