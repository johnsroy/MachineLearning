Move the initialization code from an anonymous class to a private class
to be able to handle the values from the savedInstanceState bundle
better.
A value for users are now saved in onSaveInstanceState since that was
causing an su call on every orientation change.

CustomPackageList can also be used for other things than schedules, such
as blacklists, so showList should take a filename as its parameter
rather than assume it is being used for scheduling.

As reported in issue #101
(https://github.com/jensstein/oandbackup/issues/101)
most but not all encrypted backups were broken, at least in some
instances because of incomplete pgp messages.
This may have been a sleeping bug brought out by changes in the openpgp
provider and openpgp api library.
