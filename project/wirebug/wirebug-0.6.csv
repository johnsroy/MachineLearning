We need to specify the type of network (i.e. Wi-Fi) to properly detect
connection status because the device can be connected to multiple networks
simultaneously.

And also refactor some stuff, like store various system services in member
variables to avoid unnecessary getSystemService() calls and use 4 spaces
to indent continuation lines.
