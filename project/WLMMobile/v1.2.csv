be consistent with add-photo-explained (hot cocoa)

* if username is not known then username is set as GUEST
* updated uploads to look for GUEST or the current username
* when going from welcome page to uploads page do login, if going from elsewhere
do not (e.g. after doing save for later)

TODO: any photos saved for later will show the username as GUEST
- i guess we need to update the description text at time of upload?

when you update the text of the photo object it becomes different
