this emulates the python script to load campaign data dynamically
and update window.CAMPAIGNS
the result is cached in local storage and loaded on future loads
this runs every time the app loads for the first time meaning it doesn't
disrupt the user
campaign-data.js is kept so there is always a fallback.

note: we should probably use node to generate campaigns-data.js to
avoid duplication
