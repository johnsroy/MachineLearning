This seems short enough that it's very unlikely anyone has deliberately identified and clicked on a puzzle they wanted within that time, and much more likely that it's an accidental click.

That scenario will be further mitigated by #191, but this still seems worth having as well.

The ignoring is done with a touch listener so you don't get a background flash, nor a click sound effect, where applicable.

Also fix bogus use of isIdentity (zoomMatrix has a translation in it).

This happens when opening the app with an existing game, or switching game, to a game which isn't going to show the arrow keys.

When an island changes colour (because it becomes locked or
highlighted, or goes back to plain COL_FOREGROUND from one of those
states), we were just redrawing a filled circle over the previous one,
which only really worked before antialiasing was introduced.

Fixed by reworking the entire drawing edifice to be grid-square based,
so that every grid square is either redrawn in full or left alone.
Grid squares come in two types - island and bridge - but a bridge
square can have neighbouring islands overlap into it, and the bridges
entering an island overlap the island square too, so we end up with
quite a large collection of bitfields describing each square's
contents, and some care must be taken to draw each square in the right
order.

* Clip rect is in game coordinates (i.e. the zoom matrix will be applied to it).
* We do need the ox,oy after all, to know the margin and clip to it (focus of this bug).
* We should use w,h after we know their new values.
