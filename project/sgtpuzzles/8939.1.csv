line with freedesktop.org. (This is relatively simple for Puzzles,
since it only writes to the clipboard and never reads it, so the
question of which selection to use when is most easily dealt with by
always writing to both.)

"6c57df38de85cf827cbb58fd0b14ac93bd05cef0","2010-04-25 14:57:20+00:00","Patch idea from Debian, but modified considerably in implementation:
introduce a new colour in Slant (COL_FILLEDSQUARE) which is used for
the background of any grid square that has a diagonal line in it.
This makes it easier to spot the one square on a giant board you
forgot to fill in, but on the other hand I found it to look very
strange and disconcerting. So I've set the colour to be identical to
COL_BACKGROUND by default, and users who like the idea can enable it
by environment variable or by local patch.

of basically unchanged binaries due to the compulsory rebuild of

need to change.
