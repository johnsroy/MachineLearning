Icons are the ones from https://developer.android.com/design/downloads/index.html which says 'You may use these materials without restriction to facilitate your app design and implementation.'

Remaining work is:

* Draw the ic_action_game and ic_action_type that I sketched on the issue.

* Fix the action bar flags resetting logic in onConfigurationChanged.

* As part of that, make the title disappear when undo/redo are in action bar and the screen is narrow.

* Apply changes to whether undo/redo are in action bar without a restart.

* Give the 'completed' popup darker buttons or darker versions of the icons, as it's white on grey right now.

I'm going through all my projects and reworking them to avoid
depending on the monotonic integer-valued source control revision
identifier provided by Subversion, so I can migrate everything to git
without my builds and versioning breaking.

Puzzles's version number is now of the form YYYYMMDD.vvvvvv, where
vvvvvv is some string of source control information (currently still
the SVN-style 'rNNNNN', but free to change in future). The date
provides monotonicity between my official automated builds, and the
second component is the one I'll be most interested in when people
send bug reports.

A long time ago, it seemed like a good idea to arrange that binaries
of my puzzles would automatically cease to identify themselves as a
particular upstream version number if any changes were made to the
source code, so that if someone made a local tweak and distributed the
result then I wouldn't get blamed for the results. Since then I've
decided the whole idea is more trouble than it's worth, so I'm
retiring it completely.

Also ensure at the end of a fling that we finish arriving at the final coordinate and *then* take our time to fill in, rather than jumping the last move.
