Apologies for cramming so much into one commit. This has been done intermittently over many months without getting around to proper version control, my bad... (I am at least splitting out cancelability, i18n and keyboard support into subsequent commits, because the first two of those at least are very invasive.)

Split out Android as its own build target instead of reusing some nestedvm bits (and revert the latter to upstream state).

Use the Android Native Development Kit instead of NestedVM. This improves speed, memory usage, install size, ick factor and probably other things. The downside is things like SIGSEGV are caught by the Dalvik VM and I haven't figured out a way to get a chance to talk to the user about reporting a crash.

Actually try to build icons (and if necessary, GTK binaries to produce them) if the icons aren't already there, rather than failing the build. For those not paying attention at the back, the repository contains only saved-game files for the icons, and generates them by screenshotting the GTK apps. Cool, but does mean you need working GTK build environment (libgtk2.0-dev). Therefore, put our .o files under android/tmp to avoid clashing.

Fix assorted minor bugs especially premature completion messages.

Add zipalign to end of build for a small speed boost when reading resources.

Fix some warnings about unused variables/functions with -DNDEBUG.

...and probably other changes I forgot. :-/

'from the I-wish-there-was-a-better-way-to-do-this dept.'

Scatter checks for cancellation through new_game_desc in all the puzzles with wild abandon. There are probably too many. I have only vaguely checked that this is cancelable enough, and not checked at all whether I've inserted any checks in pointless places. This could really do with reviewing by people who know how the puzzles work.

The effect of these checks is that if the UI has set the flag meaning 'user has pressed Cancel', then bomb out of new_game_desc as quickly and tidily as possible, having it return NULL.

The UI thread currently blocks on the cancel operation with Thread.join(), so the risk in the case of insufficient cancelability is one of 'Application not responding for 5 seconds, [press here to kill -9]' rather than disastrous concurrency problems.
