I forgot to add this in last week's versioning revamp, meaning that
dev builds straight from source control would fail for lack of
version.h because Buildscr is the only thing that knows how to create
it. Other projects that I restructured this way come with a static
version of version.h so that local builds can still work; I forgot
that in this one.

This gives a consistent answer, where previously, a screen close to 600dip might have got different answers depending on orientation, I guess because the navigation bar is not included.

Reluctantly introduce another view to hold a highlight colour, so the keyboard-focus rectangle can still appear around it.

Also tweak columns threshold so a 600dp-wide screen gets 2.
