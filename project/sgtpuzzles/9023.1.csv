the size of the rotating sections in Twiddle is a misnomer, since
it's actually measuring something more like the diameter of the
section. Replace the word throughout with 'rotating block size' or
similar.

applies to both drawing mechanisms, and secondly, make sure to paint
the spare pieces of window in the _puzzle's_ background colour
rather than the (sometimes slightly different) system default.

width and height by assuming mirror symmetry within the containing
applet area. Instead, use the proper width and height as given back
by the C sizing function.

(In particular, this fixes a bug where the non-blanked puzzle area
appeared too tall by the height of the menu bar, probably as a
result of confusing PuzzleApplet.getHeight() with
PuzzlePanel.getHeight(). But the mirroring approach was conceptually
wrong anyway.)

Use the puzzle background colour, like the GTK front end does.

(I know that renders the effect of the previous commit invisible,
but it's the principle of the thing! :-)
