This is 'merge -s ours', simply declaring a merge point with the new
version of the last relevant SVN change.

There are also  'git replace' mappings to replace git-svn history,
but they are *not* fetched by default and you will need to do this
if you want history to look nice:

git fetch origin 'refs/replace/*:refs/replace/*'
