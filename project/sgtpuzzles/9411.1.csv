a better upper bound on the number of bridges leaving a given island
in a given direction was not counted as having 'done something'; so a
solver run could make several such deductions, but then terminate in
the belief that it hadn't achieved anything, when just going back
round the main solver loop would have enabled it to make further
deductions based on those new bounds.

in the 'unfinished' directory for a while, and has now been finished
up thanks to James Harvey putting in some effort and galvanising me to
put in the rest. This is 'Pearl', an implementation of Nikoli's 'Masyu'.

The code in Loopy that generates a random loop along grid edges to use
as the puzzle solution has been abstracted out into loopgen.[ch] so
that Pearl can use it for its puzzle solutions too. I've also
introduced a new utility module called 'tdq' (for 'to-do queue').

Taking the dual of a grid creates a new grid with one vertex
for each face of the original and one face for each vertex. This
allows the easy introduction of a new grid type, the dual of the
octagonal grid, which is a square grid in which each square is split
into four triangles.

Of the grid types currently present, square is its own dual,
honeycomb is the dual of triangles, cairo is the dual of snub-squares,
kites is the dual of great-hexagonal, and the dodecagonal ones would
have vertices with twelve edges, probably not practical. The others
all have duals that would introduce new classes of puzzle.
