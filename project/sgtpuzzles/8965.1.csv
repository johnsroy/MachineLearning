division clues were failing to light up as erroneous if the quotient
of the numbers in them came out right under rounded-down C integer
division (e.g. 2 and 5 would be accepted for a 2/ clue). Apparently
I copied the code that invents clues in the generator straight into
the solution checker, without remembering that the generator was
allowed to do it that way because exact divisibility had been
checked elsewhere.

output (a comment from Recipe mistakenly got into the Unix
makefile); more importantly, lets mkfiles.pl run in up-to-date Perls
(where implicit split to @_ is now obsolete).

'Yes' and 'No' buttons, which means they get the standard icons that
go on thos button types. Also reorders yes/no boxes so that they're
the GNOME standard way round.

which I didn't know about, but which is clearly a waste of effort
since we keep our own backing pixmap for the puzzle window.

Cairo rendering library in place of GDK, which provides pretty
antialiased graphics much like we get on MacOS. Inertia and Untangle
are perhaps the two games most obviously improved by this.

the drawing API, for use by Loopy. It's optional: drawing.c will
construct an acceptable alternative using a filled polygon if the
front end doesn't provide it.

Net and Netslide previously had static functions called
draw_thick_line(), whose claim to the name is less justified and so
they've been renamed.

properly antialiasing-safe: all redraws are now done by clearing a
rectangle of the image, clipping to that rectangle, and redrawing
everything in it exactly once.
