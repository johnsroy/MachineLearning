Keen, Towers and Unequal (and Group) already have this feature in
common: pressing m while no square is selected, causes a full set of
pencil marks to be filled in for every square without a real number/
letter/whatever in it. Solo and Undead share the basic UI principles
(left-click to select a square then type a thing to go in it, vs
right-click to select a square then type things to pencil-mark in it),
but did not have that same feature. Now they do.

I don't know why a direct reference to a ColorDrawable doesn't work, but this seems to fix it.

Turned up the tint very slightly to compensate for the star now being visible (yellow) on top of it, making it less distinctive among starred games.
