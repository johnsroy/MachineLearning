* Use auto-linking

It was too easy to tap and would often solve the entire puzzle.

Unfortunately the combination of ACTION_SENDTO (for recipient) and EXTRA_STREAM
(for an attachment) is *still* not reliable across all email apps, therefore put
the saved game state in the body instead.

Also swaps L & R buttons by the arrow keys, if arrows are on.

Its state is remembered per backend.

Only took me 4.5 years :-p

crosshair.

Drawn rectangles and blitter edges don't line up as well as
the previous state would require, at least when density is
not an integer. This probably relates to Canvas.drawBitmap
operating at whole-pixel coordinates.
