There's more that could be done here by knowing the backend of non-save-based launches, but we'd want to know whether the launch was from a dialog box vs a URI, and such URIs are mostly hypothetical, so losing the warning on them is not a big deal right now.

The chosen density will now decrease (increasing DPI) gradually back to 1.0 as the puzzle size increases: specifically as the puzzle's preferred pixel size approaches the display's real size.

Also introduced a setting so users can retain the current (rather broken) behaviour or turn the DPI limit off entirely if they prefer.
