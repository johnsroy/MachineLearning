1) We now try to hand out cursors at a minimum.  There has always been
a fairly clean insertion layer that handles encrypting message bodies,
but the process of decrypting message bodies has always been less than
ideal.  Here we introduce a 'Reader' interface that will decrypt message
bodies when appropriate and return objects that encapsulate record state.

No more MessageDisplayHelper.  The MmsSmsDatabase interface is also more
sane.

2) We finally rid ourselves of the technical debt associated with TextSecure's
initial usage of the default SMS DB.  In that world, we weren't able to use
anything other than the default 'Inbox, Outbox, Sent' types to describe a
message, and had to overload the message content itself with a set of
local 'prefixes' to describe what it was (encrypted, asymetric encrypted,
remote encrypted, a key exchange, procssed key exchange), and so on.

This includes a major schema update that transforms the 'type' field into
a bitmask that describes everything that used to be encoded in a prefix,
and prefixes have been completely eliminated from the system.

No more Prefix.java

3) Refactoring of the MultipartMessageHandler code.  It's less of a mess, and
hopefully more clear as to what's going on.

The next step is to remove what we can from SmsTransportDetails and genericize
that interface for a GCM equivalent.

1) We now delay MMS notifications until a payload is received,
or there's an error downloading the payload.  This makes
group messages more consistent.

2) All 'text' parts of an MMS are combined into a second text
record, which is stored in the MMS row directly rather than
as a distinct part.  This allows for immediate text loading,
which means there's no chance a ConversationItem will resize.

To do this, we need to include MMS in the big DB migration
that's already staged for this application update.  It's also
an 'application-level' migration, because we need the MasterSecret
to do it.

3) On conversation display, all image-based parts now have their
thumbnails loaded asynchronously.  This allows for smooth-scrolling.
The thumbnails are also scaled more accurately.

the theme switched to whatever is configured in settings.
Now a black background without actionbar is used for the

using the light theme is visually less distracting than a white
flash when using the dark theme.

1) In addition to the Recipient interface, there is now
RecipientDevice.  A Recipient can have multiple corresponding

crypto sessions and transport delivery are done to
RecipientDevice.

2) The Push transport handles the discovery and session setup
of additional Recipient devices.

3) Some internal rejiggering of Groups.

1) Modify SessionRecord to store a list of 'previous' sessions
in addition to the current active session.  Previous sessions
can be used for receiving messages, but not for sending
messages.

2) When a possible 'simultaneous initiate' is detected, push the
current session onto the 'previous session' stack instead of
clearing it and starting over.

3) Additionally, mark the new session created on a received
possible 'simultaneous initiate' as stale for sending.  The
next outgoing message would trigger a full prekey refresh.

4) Work to do: outgoing messages on the SMS transport should
probably not use the existing session if it's marked stale
for sending.  These messages need to fail and notify the user,
similar to how we'll handle SMS fallback to push users before
a prekey session is created.

In the switch from v3, we bind identities in the message MAC
instead of doing the 1mod8 trick.  Since identity keys were
never set as 1mod8, it seemed like we could just remove it.

However, PreKeys are durable.  If an old client upgrades to v3,
it has a bunch of keys that *were* set to 1mod8 floating around.
The Curve25519 donna code re-sets the private key bits on every
operation, which results in a different key, and breaks the output
of an agreement.

So now we don't intentionally generate keys with 1mod8, but we
have to remove the donna code to honor existing 1mod8 keys for
the rest of time.  Trevor is squarely to blame.
