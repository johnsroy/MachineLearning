Notifications in SMSSecure seem to rely mainly on two public methods:

MessageNotifier.updateNotification(Context, MasterSecret, long) and
MessageNotifier.updateNotification(Context, MasterSecret)

The difference between them is that the first is also aware of in thread
notifications and triggers visual and audible alarms. Since the second
method doesn't call setLights, calling it after the first will cause the
blinking lights to stop. This patch changes a number of things:
- separate the alarms into visual and audio alarms.
- so long as the notification is not canceled, make the second method also
call setLights if the first method was previously called.
- removed unnecessary calls to the first method to avoid duplicate sound
alarms.
