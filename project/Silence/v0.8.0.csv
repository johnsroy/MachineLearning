1) Utilize the hidden API requestRouteToHostAddress that takes an
InetAddress (IPv6-capable) instead of a forced IPv4 integer-
encoded address. Will fallback to the IPv4 one if reflection
fails for whatever reason.

2) If on Lollipop and our manual MMS code doesn't work, will try
to use the Lollipop API and give it 60 seconds instead of 30,
since I did run into the timeout not being long enough in
certain conditions and I'm thinking maybe it just wasn't long
enough for some carriers.
