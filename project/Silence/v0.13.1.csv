If an Activity is set to singleInstance, then it immediately sends a cancel
to the Activity that called with startActivityForResult(), therefore this
Activity cannot get the sender of the Intent. getCallingActivity() returns
null.

'[I]f the activity you are launching uses the singleTask launch mode, it
will not run in your task and thus you will immediately receive a cancel
result.'

This update to the library fixes a bug where it would always check for the
app's own packageName (e.g. org.smssecure.smssecure) instead of the
sender's packageName (e.g. info.guardianproject.ripple), so in this case,
the Intent was never trusted.
