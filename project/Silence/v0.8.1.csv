Drawables are (strangely) mutable objects.  We reuse a single
drawable for each recipient, but some avatar views (the
conversation list -- 40dp) are larger than others (the
conversation -- 30dp).

This results in a situation where TextDrawable doesn't render
itself appropriately, because the bounds are modified by a larger
view.

Giving the Drawable an intrinsic width and height resolves this
conflict.
