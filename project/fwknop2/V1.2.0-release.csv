Sending happens in its own transparent activity so that the user only
sees the Toast notification rather than a visible activity popping up
briefly

Write to NFC tag option is in the long press context menu if Nfc exists
and is enabled.

I used a generic mime type so I can have multiple records on a tag for
use in other apps
