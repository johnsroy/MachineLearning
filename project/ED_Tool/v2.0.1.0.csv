added an extra message sent from this client to the ED_Tool-server
(https://github.com/SmokeyMcBong/ED_Tool-server)  after the initial
connection handshake to tell the server that the connection has been
made. Then the user can be aware that the server is connected to the
client.

Changed to a numerical assigned system... instead of the client sending
the full command to the server (ie ' {ESCAPE} ' or ' {BACKSPACE} ' )
the client now sends the relevant pre-assigned keycode to the server for
the server to interpret and then the server can send the relevant
KeyEvent assigned to that particular KeyCode.
Client now passes the pre-processed sendKey to 'processKeyCode', which
then matches the SendKey to the relevant KeyCode, It then sends that
KeyCode to then be sent to the server after processing

Every time the fragment gets destroyed the client now sends a 'restart'
signal to the ED_Tool-server to close the socket, open again and await
re-connection. the Client will then make sure the socket on its end is
closed. whenever that fragment is resumed or recreated the client-server
connection handshake is initialized so the re-connect is complete.
I have added this same process when opening the 'app settings', sockets
are closed, and reconnect takes place when that fragment is
reloaded/created

when the ED_Tool application is closed/exited the client socket is
closed, and the restart server signal is quickly sent to the
ED_Tool-server before closing, to tell the server to close its socket
and restart the socket creation process and await re-connection with
client.

This way anytime the app is closed accidently then the server doesn't
need to be manually restarted to regain a connection

Changed viewpager.setOffscreenPageLimit(); to allow for all fragments to
be all loaded and held in memory for easy transitions, less time spent
disconnecting/reconnecting to server, Galnet and Subreddit webview
fragments then retain their states. much better UX
