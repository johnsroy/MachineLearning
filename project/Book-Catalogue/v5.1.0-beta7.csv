'foo-bar' will now search for 'foo bar' (meaning 'foo AND bar')
'foo -bar' will now search for 'foo -bar' (meaning 'foo AND NOT bar')

This problem was highlighted by titles with hypenated words, like
Notre-dame, resulting in negations: 'notre-dame' -> 'notre AND NOT
dame'. We now allow negation, but only if preceded by a space (or at
start).
