Anthology titles that differ only in a leading space may exist in an
export file. These are trimmed on import and cause a duplicate index
error. New code checks for existing title and does not add if already
present.

Further, in prior versions, adding a second anthology title that exactly
matched an existng one would crash the app

with editor

- the code that determines if fields have been updated now relies on
data changes not clicks

- the date picker now supports dates down to 0AD

- the description field on books now displays HTML and has an edit link

- added some (commented out) debug code for dumping layouts to Utils

- Fields object now assumes TextView objects contain HTML

This is a work-in-progress. To be done:

- prevent negative dates
