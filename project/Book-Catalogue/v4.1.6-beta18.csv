BC was consistent in OK/Cancel placement, but precisely opposite to the
recent Android guidelines (and existing android apps).

Now, 'Save'/'Ok'/'Yes' is on the RHS and 'Cancel' etc on the LHS.

This was causing confusion for camera users.

Search ID was not being restored after rotation.

OnActivityResult is called *before* onResume(), so TaskManager was also
not restored in some cases. The instance variable mTaskManager is now
private and getTaskManager() handles creation as necessary.
