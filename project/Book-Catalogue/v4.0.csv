The big changes here are:

- progress dialog when looking up ISBN (and using AsyncTask).
- work flow change -- scanning a book or entering an ISBN goes
straight back to the scanner or data entry screen. This more closely
represents my work pattern, but may not be generally true.

Source code changes:

BookCatalogue:

1. Changed OnGroupClickListener to OnGroupExpandListener because both
Click and Collapse were firing on a collapse, making the lists get out
of sync.
2. Replaced addToCurrentGroup with adjustCurrentGroup to more reliably
track group open/close.
3. revised createBookScan so that it calls BookISBNSearch to manage
the barcode scanning.

BookISBNSearch:

1. Now uses ProgressDialog. Removed mIsbnStatus and related dialog
field.
2. Added code to support scanning barcodes from this activity.
3. Added a SearchForBookTask class based on AsyncTask to do ISBN
lookups.

CatalogueDBAdapter:

1. Added some CAse Insensitive indices (suffix _ci). Possibly need to
add more. Note that COLLATE NOCASE does not work with Unicode (I
believe).
2. Modified fetchAuthorPositionByName to use case insentitive matchh
and order so position is correct when comparing 'de Camp' with
'Zelazny'.

- import uses the column headers to construct a ContentValues

- Add LibraryThing support
- Assess if Google and Amazon are being handled correctly
- Look for other uses of the book String[] model and see if we can

various bug fixes

- Generalized getInputStream and added a timout to the connection to
prevent application hangs.
- Removed final vestiges of book as a String[]
- Changed AsyncTask onProgress to also send Toast messages
- Removed all Toast call from things that do not run in the UI thread
- Collects thumbnails from all sites and uses biggest
- modified fetchThumbnail() to accept a suffix to apply to file name.
Mainly useful
when id=0.
- Amazon handler now gets largest available thumbnail
- Added Utils.java that contains various useful static methods

Note: The LibraryThing api requires a developer key. This is contained
in the module
LibraryThingApiKey which contains a single method:

public class LibraryThingApiKey {
static String get() { return '<api-key-from-librarything>'; };
}

Mail has been sent to LibraryThing asking what to do about public
code. For the time being,
each developer should ask for an API key and make a local module, or
put dummy text in this
string since covers thumbnails still work with a dummy string.

TODO:
- Database changes to use the multiple series and multiple authors
that LibraryThing returns

1. When many fields were hidden, getting values from UI Spinners
resulted
in unexpected null values. Similarly, date_published was stored and
retrieved as null causing conversion routines to fail.

2. Modified interface used in Utils.pruneList to support a new method
instead of manually checking the name string (I have some authors with
brackets in their names). Also, modified DB code that stores series to
allow more than one entry for the same series. Finally, changed the
unique index on book_series to include series_num.

NOTE: This update will crash if used with a database created a
previous non-production version if books are added to the same series
more than once.

dynamic property pages

- detect case-sensitive UNICODE collate
- wrap sort fields in lower() if necessary (adds 25% perf overhead to
list building). It's only happening on ICS, so impact is less noticeable
as ICS machines are generaly faster. In the longer term, consider
duplicated (lower case) fields in the summary table IF Android
perpetuates this behaviour.

database

- ICS does not seem to cope with transparent ListView backgrounds with a

- Allow for the possibility of 2 threads using the same database object
and requesting transactions where at least on is an update transaction.
This should be allowed because the SynLocks will make one wait
