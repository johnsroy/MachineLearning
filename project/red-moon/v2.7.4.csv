Sometimes when using the old shortcut, you can see the activity opening and instantly closing again. By using a transparent style for the new activity, users can never see it.
The new activity also has less to do in onCreate, so it might be a bit faster.
Users need to create their shortcuts anew in order to profit from the improvement, old shortcuts will keep working as they did before.
Side effect: using the new shortcut, ShadesActivity doesn't finish anymore when it's already open and the shortcut is launched.
