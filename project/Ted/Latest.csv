Our automatic tool confirmed that the original save pattern (write data
-> delete file -> rename file) can lead to user data loss at power down
or system crash.

Enhanced crash consistency by performing buffer flush and file system
synchronization in file saving. This also ensures the user's file is
saved immediately.
