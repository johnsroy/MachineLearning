• Update for policy reasons (no functional changes to version 1.2.6)
• completly removed the 'Donation' dialog as it violated Google's
Content Policy and/or Developer Distribution Agreements (and lead to the
expulsion of the app from the Play Store)
• new package ID for the app (so technically this is a new app and not just
an update of the old app) because the old package ID stays blocked
permanently in Play Store (unfortunately)
• changed app name from 'Bankomat Card Infos' to 'Bankomat Card Infos 2'
