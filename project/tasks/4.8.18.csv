Before this change:
* We used to have the wrong build requirements in .travis.yml
* The Android linter crashed during CI

The Android linter crash is this problem:
https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber/issues/109

We work around it in this change by explicitly calling .toString() on a
parameter to a logging call.

As for the wrong requirements, this change simply updates them.
