I implemented the workaround as Tim suggested by introducing the new interface
AstridFilterExposer and used it in the FilterAdapter-class. Additionally, I
had to introduce a fallback resultReceiver that is called after the last
filterexposer finished and checks if the filterlist-screen is empty. In this
case it uses a pre-fetched lists of Astrids registered receivers for filters
and uses the new interface on them to get the FilterListItem-instances.
