No conflict-handling yet between Astrid-repeats and PDV-repeats other than disabling PDV-repeats for tasks that have Astrid-repeats enabled. But still, duplicates might be produced by this. Another glitch is, if a task is completed on webinterface and in Astrid in parallel, and synced, then PDV-recurrent tasks' duedate on webinterface gets added one day (could be due to faulty timezone-handling in producteev.api.ApiUtilities (SimpleDateFormat-instances are hardcoded on Locale.US and thus dont write +0100-timezone for me in Europe/Berlin but +0000)
