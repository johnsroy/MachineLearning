---------------------------------

Astrid's library projects (astridApi and GreenDroid) have moved to become
part of this repository. This will make your life easier, but if you have
already imported astridApi, you will have to delete this project from
Eclipse and re-import it from its new location within the api/ folder of
this repository.

Thanks!
