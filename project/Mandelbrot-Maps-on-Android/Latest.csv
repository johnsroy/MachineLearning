scaling, but that was in before).

There seems to be an intermittent bug where pin gets half-selected but
doesn't drag, just stays big and can't be dragged further. Set
holdingPin to false when adding new little view, so at least removing
and re-adding the little view should fix it. Maybe.

Also removed logging that was happening every time the pin moved at all,
which made it a fair bit less laggy.
