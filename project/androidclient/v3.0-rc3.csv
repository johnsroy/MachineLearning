A combined bug of Android and DAVDroid makes all contacts not
belonging to at least 2 groups not being seen by Kontalk sync
because of filtering on IN_VISIBLE_GROUP=1. This preference, if
enabled, will remove that filter and will include all contacts.

The adaptive ping manager will now wait for at least the full interval of the
next ping before incrementing back that interval after a success. This way,
the ping interval will stay fixed until the device can hold more.

Experiments on 3G/4G networks showed that below 90 seconds
connection remains stable. Just passing the 90 seconds threshold,
the connection is quietly destroyed by the carrier.

There are still some glitches in this adaptive algorithm (namely:
learning stickness, that is, the algorithm tends to forget soon
what was the best value, I'll have to work on that).
