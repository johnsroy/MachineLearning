Two issues were fixed.

1. reusing a ContentValues object led to a unique constraint violation on the
users database
2. forcing to use the roster name if no public key was found for a contact led
to show the default roster name for it (i.e. the hash), overwriting the real
display name of the contact

As I suspected, using a specific ContentObserver for each contact doesn't work.
The system always fires global change notifications thereby rendering the
observers useless. I'll be using a single observer that invalidates the whole
cache - that's a shame.
