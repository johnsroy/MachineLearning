--- DefaultCellScanner in the client needed updates to take over

--- CellScannerNoWCDMA in the service previous hosted the ScreenMonitor,
removed this usage
-- PersistentIntentService is moved from service to service/utils

- SharedConstants renamed to AppGlobals, and this class gets new
guiLogInfo/Error util function. (dataStorageManager global is added
here, this class arrives in the next commit)
-- requred minor name change in CellScanner, PassiveServiceReceiver,
MapActivity, WifiScanner, GPSScanner

- Delete ContentResolver(s), Database.java

- DatabaseContract is now DataStorageContract, and has the constants

- DataStorageManager is the backend, it has an in-memory working buffer
for collecting reports, and in-memory buffer of reports to be sent,
and a list of files on disk (with about 50 reports per file). Please see the documentation  for the class, it explains this in more detail.

-- After data leaves the in-memory working buffer, it is zipped, this
required some changes to the network code to handle pre-zipped data
(AbstractCommunicator.java)

-- The constructor of DataStorageManager also upgrades the sync stats from the old DB.

- Removing the DB propagates changes to StumblerBundle, StumblerBundleReceiver, Submitter, Reporter.
The logic is unchanged in these classes, just cleanup for the backend.
