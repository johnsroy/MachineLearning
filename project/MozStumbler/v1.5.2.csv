Arguably, one can check if particular location providers are available. This is only useful if the code then takes further useful actions based on this info. We have no interest in handling this case beyond not crashing and putting an error in the log. Why is the network provider unavailable anyway? What is the mojo on the device required to reproduce this? I tried airplane mode, restricting geolocation to GPS only.  Neither triggered this.
Issue #1311
