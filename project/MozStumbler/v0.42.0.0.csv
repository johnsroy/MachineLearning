* removed slf4j logger from osmdroid and replace it with the mozilla logger
* Aggressively prune down the osmdroid codebase to just the parts that are essential so that we can properly test components.
* Fixed some bad exception logging in HttpUtil::get
* Discarded the LRUMapTileCache::TileRemovedListener as it's never used
* Removed < GINGERBREAD support from the LRUMapTileCache::remove method
* Added some comments to recycling ReusableBitmapDrawable instances - I'm pretty sure we *only* use ReusableBitmapDrawable instances
* Added more warning level logging to see what's going on with download errors in the TileDownloaderDelegate.
* Removed useless logging message when the SmartFSProvider fails to load anything.
* Threading has been simplified now so we don't have separate disk IO threads and network download IO threads.
* We just have IO threads as networking and caching is tightly coupled together within the SmartFSProvider.
* All threading is actually handled by an ExecutionService within the MapTileModuleProviderBase
* Dropped MapTileFilesystemProvider as it's no longer used.
* Dropped MapTileFileStorageProviderBase and adjusted the class inheritance.
* All error logging now requires either an exception (possibly null) to be passed in as the last argument.
* Some error logging events have been demoted to just warnings as no actual error has occurred.
* Removed unused constants
* changed noisey log level messages to debug
* bump the size up of the size of the MapTileCache in the abstract TileProvider by 100 tiles.
* In debug builds - I've added Map and Cover prefixes to the tile overlays so that you can see which tile are actually being used.
* The BitmapTileSourceBase will now label tiles based on a BuildConfig parameter
* Swapped out DefaultApacheHttpClient for HttpUrlConnection when downloading tiles

* I've disabled the handleTile method in the ZoomInLooper as well as
the ZoomOutLooper so that they no longer do anything.  This forces
tiles to load from disk or network instead of trying to rescale
pre-existing tiles and storing/loading them from an LRU cache which
may evict tiles.

I believe the bugs in ZoomInLooper and ZoomOutLooper are causing
the long standing bug in osmdroid listed here:
