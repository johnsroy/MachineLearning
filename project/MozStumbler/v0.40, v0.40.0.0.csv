Major cleanup of AsyncUploader

* AsyncUploader no longer maintains any state anymore except for a
single AtomicLong to hold onto the number of bytes uploaded.

* AsyncUploader requires a proper AsyncUploadParam argument when
invoking execute() now.  This encapsulates the useWifiOnly, an
upload listener, and the nickname
and email address

* onPostExecute has been removed as it simply called onUploadComplete
which is only implemented in the MetricsView, and that only invoked
updateUIThread().  MetricsView::updateUIThread() is also invoked on
any upload progress, so those calls have been consolidated.

* AsyncUploader::UploadSettings has been removed entirely, as it was
just a wrapper around the useWifiOnly boolean.

* Dropped SyncSummary as we were only using it to accumulate the
total bytes during a single execution of AsyncUploader.

* AsyncUploader::isUploading() has been removed entirely.  AsyncTasks
can only be used once, having a singleton manage the current
threaded upload state makes no sense.  This needs to be checked by
subscribing to the AsyncTask using the AsyncUploaderListener
interface.

* MetricsView manages it's own atomic isUploading flag which is
modified when the AsyncUploader updates it's progress.

Changed code to use just draw rect and circle, and tested with 3000

Also, lowered the drawing timeout even further to 30 ms, this only
represents part of the drawing pipeline, there is still raster overlays, so we should be
aggressive about stopping the drawing early.
