The capacity of the underlying LinkedHashMap has been modified to be 2x the requested capacity as there's a mismatch in meanings.

The callers is asking for capacity in terms of tiles, the capacity for a linked hash map is the # of hash buckets available which is a smaller number.

The final effect of this patch is that memory usage is pretty constant @ ~37MB on a Moto G with a 5x5 tile screen, but this adds significant flicker.

The upside is that this finally seems to fix the memory consumption error and no more OOM death.

This prevents the swapping over hig/low res maps from consuming

This should mitigate the memory leak mentioned at the end of
