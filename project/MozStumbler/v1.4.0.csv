- System ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED intent drives the battery check code
- In the ClientStumblerService, in the battery checking code, if the
battery is low and the user starts the service manually, battery
checking is deactivated until the battery is ok again.
- Send a dedicated low battery intent from the ClientStumblerService on
low battery. (Received by MainApp)

Uses 2-part detection:
1) DetectUnchangingLocation is used to determine if the user has not
moved in 2 minutes, then the ScanManager pauses (this is a low power
state)
2) When the MotionSensor detects movement (which uses very low power
sensors to do so), start scanning again.

Also worth noting, the notification text changes when paused, and the
map view shows a paused message also.

- MapLocationListener will use the network listener until the GPS
kicks in.
