"f9dad5348f79459f7a289c0d7ed83d0c1b14fffb","2015-03-02 11:27:36-05:00","This adds a testcase to make sure that the TileDownloaderDelegate can properly handle an HTTP 598 response which indicates some kind of networking error.
I've removed a scary warning message in TileDownloaderDelegate referenced in #1505 removed a duplicate ClientLog.w message.
HTTPResponse now has an additional constructor that accepts a HTTP Status code and a transmit byte length. This makes construction of statuses like 598 easier to build.
HTTPUtil no longer returns NULL in any case.  You will always get a 404, or a 598 on an error.
