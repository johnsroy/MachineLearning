* Added an invalidate() call on MapView::setZoom so that any zoom
change forces a viewport redraw

Note that this will snap back your zoom level if you haven't zoomed in
by a full level.  This behaviour was less obvious before the patch,
but is happened before as well.  It just happened in 2 steps.  Pinch
zoom with an edge that is not redraw, then on the next redraw, the
zoom level would snap back.

The pixel grid hashing was not accounting for the panning. Now when the
pixel hash is created, track the current pan state.
