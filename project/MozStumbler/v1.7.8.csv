* This adds 3 new intents to the ScanManager that are broadcast when the state changes to start, stop or paused.
* Those 3 intents are listened to by the MainApp now to keep track of the service state removing a dependency to service.isStopped()

I think the bug is that the NetworkLocationChangeDetector sets the
initial location with a GPS location, then compares it to the Network
location.
The last time I tried these options was a year ago, and I was not
getting onLocationChanged when I expected it to (sporadically missing
sending this event), so I have avoided using them.
