Added tests and code to support lazily bound Proxy objects for all
services.  This is required to support static assignment of member
attributes like log instances.

Pulled out all the logic for the logging into a debug logger and a
production logger as we can no longer depend on BuildConfig to switch
loggers at runtime.  The logger must be set explicitly now on
application startup.

Minor tweaks to the ServiceLocator to iron out some edge case
initialisation race conditions.

Updated all log instances to use the new logger service.
Rationalized the makeLogTag calls to always require a class.
