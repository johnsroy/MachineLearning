Note: does not work with e.g. IntelliJ IDEA, because it builds the
project out of the git directory! In this case 'empty version name' is
shown as version.

Get the version number from an annotated git tag (parameter '-a').

versionName: ignore leading non-digits and everything after the first underscore
versionCode: take digits after the first underscore

To get versionName '0.1' and versionCode '2' valid tags are, e.g. 0.1_2,
release-0.1_2, foo0.1_2, foo0.1_2_bar. See source code comments for
further information.

If no tag is found, the current branch is taken as versionName. Default
versionCode is '1'.

* rename the variable
* let the user not cancel the progress dialog
* make the text to be shown more general. We also receive the json file
from server in the background

When the back button is pressed, e.g. in settings activity or in gastro
activity, main list activity's onCreate is called. So the json file is
fetched again from the server and the location is retrieved again as
well. For the latter we have introduced a swipe refresh layout. We
should avoid downloading the json file again and again, while navigating
through the application.

Android knows that the answer of a negative dialog can never be save, so
it just dismisses the dialog (even if autoDismiss is false). Changing
the dialog to positive the user can select and re-select several times
and the selection can actually be saved.

* version name is the annotated tag found on a commit or the branch you
are currently on

* version code has to be set manually for the following reason: until
today the version code would be increased with every release, because of
the tag, e.g. '0.1_1', '0.1_2', '0.1_3', and so on. After a release it
would be directly set to '1' again, because of the missing tag. That way
Android would complain after every release, that a developer wants to
install an old version of the app. The version name is not taken into
account by Android in this case
