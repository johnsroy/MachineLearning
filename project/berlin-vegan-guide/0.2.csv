Keyline Pushing v1.2 by Faiz Malkani is an app, which helps a developer
to check if the app fulfills the Google style guidelines for material
design. It draws an 8dp grid and the keyline over all other app,
allowing one to easily check the baselines of any app's components.

Also set card corner radius to 0dp to have the rectangular material
design.

Note: this is still not the final layout.

Previous commit applied the material design guidelines with help of
'Keyline Pushing' app to the card view. See last commit for further
details. This commit improves the layout of the gastro details fragment:
the indentation is either 8dp or 16dp, and the vertical gap is either
8dp or 4dp.

Unfortunately soft hyphen (&shy;) is only partially working with
fromHtml(): the word gets split at the correct place, but the hyphen
(dash) is not shown. This might be very annoying to the user, because it
just does not look right. As a workaround we do not split words at all.

Closes #13
