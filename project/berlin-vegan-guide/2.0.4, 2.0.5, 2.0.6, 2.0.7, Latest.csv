At out last meeting we decided to use the hard-coded ACRA secret again,
because we did not see an easy way to get the secret into a F-Droid
build from the outside.

This commit just reverts several commits:

Revert 'Don't check for shared secret in the FOSS builds'

This reverts commit 23bac7e2b851a67a2632ec4816346d175c6f6782.

Revert 'complain if parameter is missing in release build'

This reverts commit 00a226946ebdf79dd4d52684eb9a71e0dc00bfd0.

Revert 'remove hard coded acra shared secret'

This reverts commit 8337c5d6487e8859231292965568f8a66c224c30.

The problem of this commit: It is not working at the moment :(.

The fragments on their own are working (more or less perfectly)
if you add them right in the beginning (at line 135 of
LocationListActivity.java), but the swap is not working.

Perhaps it is not possible to do a fragment replace within a SwipeRefreshLayout?

FYI: The map fragment doesn't show any entries if you
add it at the beginning, but it does show the entries
if you add *no* fragment at the beginning and add
the map fragment on icon press in the menu bar.

Just uncomment

>         getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction().add(mSwipeRefreshLayout.getId(),
>         mLocationListFragment).commit();

in line 135 of LocationListActivity.java, compile&run, hit the
map button (the earth in the top bar), and the map works.

Before this patch, we were able to switch between list view and map
overview, but the map view was empty, because of the swipe refresh
layout. This layout is not good to use with a map view anyways, because
scrolling down triggers the refresh.

We therefore use just a frame layout around the swipe layout like
Android suggests in the documentation.

Further changes:
* use correct map icon from http://github.com/google/material-design-icons/
* add list icon from http://github.com/google/material-design-icons/
* make the menu bar consistent: in the map overview just display an
entry to switch back. Also if the user searched in the list view,
dismiss the search (mSearchItem.collapseActionView()). We do not
support a dynamic map overview currently

rating in the FOSS variant, so we are good for now.
