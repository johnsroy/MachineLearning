From now on we bump the version code directly after a release. That way
a developer always gets noticed by Android if he/she tries to downgrade
to a release version.

With a new entry in the filter list a user is able to show his/her saved
favorites. Therefore he/she can mark a location as favorite in the
gastro activity by clicking on the outlined star, that then turns to a
filled one to mark the favorite.

Closes #4

We had some spammers lately. So we pass the shared secret for ACRA to

Note: this is only relevant to release builds, since acra is disabled
for debug builds. A developer does not have to add a parameter to
his/her gradle config. The shared secret is just empty then.
