Hi Michael,

verstehe nicht ganz, wieso einmal account und dann wieder conto? und folgenden Satz habe ich auch nicht verstanden:

Inserisci come molte somme parziali come necessari attraverso i comandi di menu per la somma parziale

Sonst habe ich ein paar grammatikalische Ausbesserungen vorgenommen.
Lg
Gudrun
