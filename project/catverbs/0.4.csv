There's a dictionary application called Catalan Dictionary that has
links for the articles in verbs to its website to show the
conjugation. This adds an intent to intercept the URLs and show them
in Catverbs instead. The verb is shown in the SearchActivity by
filling in the search box.

Like the ArticleActivity, it now handles the intent only once in
onStart the first time it is started after onCreate. Otherwise it
resets the search string everytime you return to the application.

That way when choosing the application to use for the URL the name
‘Catverbs’ will appear instead of ‘Buscar’. It will also make it
possible to jump directly to the article instead of the search view.

directly display the article instead of showing the search page.
