Vibha did some user testing and found that some people have trouble figuring
out how to search again once they've done an initial search. This could be
because the text you search for remains in the text box after you've searched.
Since there's not a particularly good reason to leave that text in there, this
patch clears the search box every time someone navigates to a new page.

In the 'Read in another language' option and 'Wikipedia language' setting, the
languages are displayed with the current device language's name in large text,
and the name of the language in the language itself in small text. This patch
flips that behaviour, so that the name of the language in the language itself
is prioritised.
