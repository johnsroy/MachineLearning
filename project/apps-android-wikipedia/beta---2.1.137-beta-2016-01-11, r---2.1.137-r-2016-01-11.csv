Move content issues and similar titles to page menu and move save pages
and share a link to the article toolbar.

* Keep the JavaScript issue and disambiguation parsing logic but send
the issues and disambiguations payload when available instead of on
link click.

* Extract 'PageInfo' unmarshaller from PageInfoHandler, where info is
issues and disambiguations, into a single responsibility class.
'Handlers' often have nebulous responsibilities, as was the case for
PageInfoHandler. Move the remainder of the logic to another handler,
LeadImagesHandler, and delete PageInfoHandler.

* DRY up leadImagesHandler.beginLayout() logic. This required adding an
inappropriate method to the PageLoadStrategy which has been marked for
removal, and will be easier to do so in subsequent refactors.

* Annotate PageInfo with @NonNull where appropriate and add a couple
helper methods.

* Move the lead image and lead image placeholder to
ArticleHeaderImageView. Improve encapsulation but there are some
obvious candidates for future improvement.

* Add a new toolbar class, ArticleMenuBarView for saved pages, link
sharing, and other buttons. The saved pages button does not update
appropriately. This appears to be a preexisting bug.

* Replace LeadImagesHandler.leadImagesEnabled state with method.

* Minor adjustments to padding offsets in LeadImagesHandler.

* Move intToHexStr() logic from MediaPlayerImplementation to StringUtil
so it can be used elsewhere.

* Adjust WebView content top margin.

* Remove the last programmatic change to article lead LayoutParams.

* Fix a couple layout bugs in lead layout including top offset
differences across API versions and some incorrect layouts on
orientation change.

* Reorder page issues and disambiguations in their dialog.

Rename verbose page loading methods where the class responsibility
implies function.

- Rename PageActivity/Fragment.displayNewPage and friends to loadPage.
These classes are primarily responsible for loading and displaying
pages. The client should expect that pages need to be loaded to be
displayed but that the class is responsible for any page load request
from inception to displaying. 'Page' may be dropped in the future, but
currently these classes have many responsibilities so the distinction
is still useful.
- Rename Json/PageLoadStrategy.onDisplayNewPage to load. From the
perspective of the strategy, this method actually initiates a loading
sequence and is not a callback terminus. 'load' was chosen because a
page load strategy should only load one thing, pages. Similarly,
rename loadPageFromBackStack to loadFromBackStack and a couple helper
methods in JPLS.
- Rename Json/PageLoadStrategy.onBackPressed to popBackStack since
popping the back stack is its primary responsibility and it is a
sequence initiator not a terminus. It may be called from a Fragment's
onBackPressed, but that's not its concern nor its limitation.
Additionally, consolidate a private JPLS helper method.
- Group Json/PageLoadStrategy methods in the interface and
implementation according to function.

No functional changes intended.

â€¢ Fix always false instanceof test assertions:

âœ— assertThat(result.getClass(), instanceOf(Expected.class))
âœ“ assertThat(result, instanceOf(Expected.class));

â€¢ Move callback invocation to main thread. In general, UI callbacks are
expected to be invoked on the main thread.

â€¢ Move test's anonymous inline callback to a static nested class that
just exposes a latch interface. Inline creation blows the method
count and increases the indentation level which decreases readability
and often discourage DRYness.

â€¢ Use test's new latched callback to just wait until the AsyncTask is
done and then perform assertions on the data in the test thread.
Assertion failures in AsyncTasks seem to actually kill the runner
instead of just failing a single test. I'm not 100% sure on this.

â€¢ Add @VisibleForTesting to OnSyntaxHighlightListener so the reader
knows this is test-only code. Bubble the interface to the top of the
class so it's better delineated from the data.

â€¢ Replace Activity parameter with ContextThemeWrapper. CTW is needed to
get themed attributes but Activities are heavy to test.

â€¢ Initialize handler member prior to setting a listener that could
invoke it.

â€¢ Drop onCatch logging and isCancelled check. These are already done in
