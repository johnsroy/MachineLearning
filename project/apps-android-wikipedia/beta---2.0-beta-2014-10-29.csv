Right now, the 'start' event for onboarding is fired every time the activity
is created. This means that if the user closes the app and leaves it in the
background for a long time (and then the activity is destroyed by Android),
the event is fired again when they reopen the app. This should track on a
user-by-user basis, so this is actually pointless.

This patch changes the activity so that it only fires the 'start' event the
first time the activity is created. That way, we can get closer to figuring
out the true bounce rate (on a user-by-user basis, rather than a view-by-view
basis).

not go on the backstack)
- The Search fragment now encapsulates two sub-fragments:
TitleSearchFragment and FullSearchFragment.
- Not using any kind of ViewPager or tab component... just the two
fragments overlaid in a FrameLayout, making the code somewhat simpler.
- The Search fragment also contains a blank layout where 'recent' searches
will go. (Recent searches appear when the search field is empty)
- Made the size of list items consistent between Title and Full search.
- Made the 'Search' action bar item part of PageActivity, so that it
appears globally, no matter what type of fragment is at the top of the
backstack.

This patch changes the shared preferences system of the app so that it's at
the correct level of abstraction. Presently, classes extending Funnel interact
directly with the preference manager to get feature install IDs, and that
should probably be handled centrally in WikipediaApp rather than in each
class.

This patch:
* Makes the SharedPreferences of the app a field in WikipediaApp.
* Instantiates the SharedPreferences field in the WikipediaApp constructor.
* Changes ad-hoc retrieval of the SharedPreferences to use the field instead.
* Creates generic retrieval method for install IDs in WikipediaApp.
* Creates accessor methods for the install IDs, which use the generic method.
* Changes classes that extend Funnel to use the install ID accessor methods.

This patch makes it so that when such a 'Did you mean' query is run, the text
