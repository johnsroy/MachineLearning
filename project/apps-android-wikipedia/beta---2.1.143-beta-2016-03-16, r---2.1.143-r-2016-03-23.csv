Database upgrades are exceptional. Upgrading differently based on
originating version is a small performance gain for a large liability
and test matrix. This patch changes upgrades to always follow the same
path with each version upgraded sequentially until the current db
version is met. This means that if an upgrade on the oldest version of
the app works, all the upgrades in between should too. Additionally,
table upgrade logic was pushed from the abstract super into the subclass
implementation to keep responsibilities separate.

Upgrades between each version work prior to this patch so testing was
performed from each of the following versions directly to this patch:

• 2.0 (2014-06-25)
• 2.0 (2015-03-23)
• 2.0.102 (2015-05-14)
• 2.0.107 (2015-08-03)
• 2.0.110 (2015-08-31)
• 2.1.136 (2015-12-09)
• 2.1.140 (2016-02-04)
• 2.1.141 (2016-02-10)
• 2.1.142 (2016-03-07)

The only necessary workarounds I had to make have to do with the system
bar, and the inability to set its flags via styles. It looks like the
'windowTranslucentStatus' and 'windowFullScreen' flags no longer work when
set via an inherited theme, so I'm setting them in the code.

Also, the 'save page' icon in the toolbar wasn't getting the proper tint
(possibly a bug with tinting state drawables?), so I changed the bookmark
drawable itself to be explicitly white, since it's not used anywhere else.

Also, the new version seems to have broken the
getResources().getDisplayMetrics() function, where it fails to update the
metrics upon screen rotation. I made a workaround for this, as well.

The new version of the Support library allows RecyclerViews to have
'wrap_content' dimensions. In our link preview window, this means that we
can now center-align the thumbnail gallery when there are fewer images
than the width of the dialog.

I'm therefore removing the minimum number of images shown in the thumbnail
gallery.

To test: go to the [[Earth]] article, and click on the [[Greek]] link in
the first sentence.  Thumbnail galleries with three or more images should
not be affected.
