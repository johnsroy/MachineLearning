http://i.imgur.com/Uybx5G4.png?1

Here's what currently happens:
- The app launches for the first time, and the RbSwitch singleton is
statically initialized.
- Inside its private constructor is the only place where it updates the
state of the 'useRestBase' preference.
- The RemoteConfig task, which fetches the remote variable that determines
RestBase enrollment, completes *after* RbSwitch is initialized, meaning
that the 'useRestBase' preference doesn't get updated until the current
instance of the app is terminated and restarted. This may help account
for the relatively slow uptake of RB usage.

OkHttp does not play nicely with nginx over HTTP/2 and this is causing
our connection to fail when trying to log in or make an edit.

This workaround will fix our issue while Square works on resolving
