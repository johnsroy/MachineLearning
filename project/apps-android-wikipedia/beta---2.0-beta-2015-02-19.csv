Maybe related to https://github.com/Prototik/HoloEverywhere/issues/577
'In onPrepareOptionsMenu, calling menu.findItem returns null when pressing 'menu' key'

Also refactored the findItem calls since they are potentially expensive
and savePageMenu is used multiple times.

I assume that if the first menu item is not null the others would not be
null as well. If that's not the case we should get more reports like this
with newer releases. But it think that's unlikely.

As of API 11, the proper way to present lists of settings is by using a
PreferenceFragment instead of PreferenceActivity.  And because the activity
that contains the new Fragment inherits from ActionBarActivity, it indirectly
fixes the rendering issues that we saw with checkboxes.

Unfortunately API 10 does not support PreferenceFragment, so we have to keep
the old PreferenceActivity specifically for compatibility with API 10.

Also reverted the previous fix for the checkbox rendering issue.

statement only executes when the app is handled an Intent it doesn't

breakpoints, I've found out that this else statement is also triggered if the
user taps on the app from their home screen, which is far from out of the
