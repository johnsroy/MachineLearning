- Added an Activity for viewing individual images clicked from a page.
Eventually the activity may be adapted to accommodate a scrollable
gallery of images.
- The activity has a Toolbar with a gradient background, as well as a
blank container for description and license information, and a stub menu
item for displaying additional (exif) information.
- Created task for retrieving metadata for an individual File page.

Currently, there are three separate places in PageViewFragmentInternal where
you want to hide all of the content of the page. Previously this was just the
web view, but now we have extra native components for content (lead images,
read more) which need to be hidden too.

This method adds a hidePageContent convenience method to the class, to reduce
code duplication.

This patch abstracts this interaction to the WikipediaApp class, so that these

So, in a couple cases in our code, we perform transactions with the
FragmentManager from the result of AsyncTasks. This is technically
frowned-upon, since at that point the task has no way of knowing the state
of the Activity (whether its instanceState has been saved), which can lead
to an exception being thrown when we try to commit() a fragment
transaction.

Fortunately there is a function called commitAllowingStateLoss() which is
designed specifically for this purpose. Therefore I've split off the
functions that deal with fragment transactions, and gave them a parameter
to optionally allow state loss. Going forward, if we need to push a
fragment from an AsyncTask result, we should allow state loss, but *only*
in those cases.  In all other cases, the regular commit() function should
still be used.

Specifically, the cases where we now allow state loss (in this patch) are:
- Fetching a Random page.
- Going to the Main page after changing the Wiki language.
