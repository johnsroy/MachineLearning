This patch slightly decreases the minimum text size on Share a Fact cards.
This allows medium-length quotes to be fit on the cards.

Also increased the top padding to be similar to the left/right padding per Vibha's request.
It's not exactly the same value because there is some ascender height space above the cap height.

Some light miscellaneous clean up of various scripts:

- Set Python and Bash interpreters to /usr/bin/env X as appropriate.
- Set executable bit on Python and Bash scripts.
- Update support library version to match target API level.
- Replace double with single quotes where possible in build.gradle.
- Include release signing properties path when not present in error output.
- Change Gradle wrapper distribution URL to reference 'all' instead of 'bin'.

This patch changes the 'read more' suggestions to not display outside the main
namespace, because the current method we use to generate them (hitting the
search API) doesn't generate meaningful results for things like talk pages and
