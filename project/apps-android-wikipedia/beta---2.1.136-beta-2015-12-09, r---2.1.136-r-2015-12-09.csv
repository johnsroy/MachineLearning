Easy fix. Just change one missed print keyword to functional notation.
This change appears to be backwards compatible with Python 2 without
future imports.

The page namespace column is unavailable prior to app database v6. This

One method of reproducing the bug is to save pages with spaces on

For nonproduction builds, temporarily allow problematic tabs to be
discarded and tabs in the new 6191e5e format to be written.

Per 59dce5f, in nonproduction builds the penalty for remote logging
should be death. The thinking was that if it's worth burning user data
and engineering parsing time, it's worth crashing on everything but
prod. A TODO has been added to revert this patch when the next beta,
2.1.135 is published.

1) We no longer need to correlate the 'index' property between the

2) However, the redirected results can sometimes contain a 'tofragment'

section to which the result should jump upon loading.

Refactor JsonPageLoadStrategy's sequence state and DRY up some
JavaScript event listeners:
* Remove sequence reset in onActivityCreated() method. The sequence
number is not preserved after app death so an int is practically
infinite and does not need to be reset. The sequence is incremented
indirectly as needed by an internal call to fragment.displayNewPage().
Guaranteeing a monotonically increasing sequence number reduces the
potential for nonunique sequence number bugs.
* Encapsulate sequence and reconciliation behavior. This allows one tiny
class to be responsible for the data. Presently, only that the
sequence is always increasing. This isn't immediately useful beyond
that but does make future mishaps less casual than --ing an int.
* Replace common Fragment lifecycle and sequence checks in
JSEventListeners with abstract SynchronousBridgeListener class.
* Replace 'sequence' String constant with symbol.

1) This fixes an actual possible condition where this crash occurs:
- A saved page is loaded, and the LoadSavedPageTask takes an abnormally
long time
- The user presses Back, with the previous page having *more* sections
than the saved page
- The LoadSavedPageTask completes in the middle of the WebView being
populated with the previous page, replacing the current Page object with
a Page that has fewer sections than the current sequence chain expects.

2) This also explicitly patches up the crash, by verifying that the index
is within the size of the current page sections.
