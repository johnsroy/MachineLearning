In a subsequent patch we'll restore pinch-to-zoom in the Gallery using a
different means.

NB2: This also restricts the native ABIs that get packaged into the APK,

Mapbox is updated for arm64, we should remove the restriction.

When passing the text selection from the WebView to the Java layer, we
limit the number of characters on the WebView side, which is not a bad
thing, because a large enough selection can lead to an OOM error.

However, for the purpose of copying the selection to the clipboard, it can
be a hindrance to limit the number of characters, and is confusing to the
user. This patch copies the selected text by simulating a 'Ctrl-C'
keyboard event, and dispatches it to the WebView, which causes it to copy
the selection to the clipboard natively.

Additionally, this allows the copied text to preserve any *formatting*
and/or links, instead of simply copying plain text.

Apologies for the size of this patch; it's larger than originally
envisioned. However, as I started to work on fixing the initial crash, I
saw an opportunity to improve the whole thing, in the following ways:

- When sharing an image, we're now using the Fresco image pipeline (per
their guidelines), and making a copy of the resulting bitmap for the
purpose of sharing. It might look like the code asks Fresco to download
the image again, but it's extremely likely that Fresco will pull the
image from cache instead of going to the network, so this is OK.

- When saving an item, we ask ourselves: 'Is the user's intention to
save the scaled-down image shown in our gallery, or the *original*
full-resolution image from Commons?' It's highly likely to be the
latter. And also, when saving videos or other types of media, it
*must* be the latter. The app now handles all of this correctly. We
now switch to using Android's aptly-named DownloadManager, which
handles downloading of files automatically, and even gives us a
Notification for free (with a progress bar)! We then intercept the
download completion event, and notify the device's MediaStore to
update its Gallery app, so that it shows the new media items.

No functional changes intended.

• Consolidate duplicate URI logic in DatabaseTable. In some cases, a
database client was acquired by URI, in others, by authority. However,
the underlying call to
Context.getContentResolver().acquireContentProviderClient(Uri) makes
an equivalent call to acquireContentProviderClient(String authority).
• Replace lazy initialization of DatabaseTable.baseContentURI with
initialization in the constructor.
• Replace Uri.parse() with Uri.Builder; use content protocol symbol.
