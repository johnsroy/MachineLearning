Since apparently just loading a javascript: URL is a blocking
operation and also quite slow when passing in a large amount of
data, we just pass in a pointer and then use another method to
retreive the data.

The 'other' method is using the JavascriptInterface. This is
known to fail in some 2.3 devices with low memory and also
in 2.3 emulators. But the performance boost that we get
from this is significant enough to risk it, and I think
in the future if necessary we can implement a fallback in
the cases when this method of communication does not
work.

Added a check for cancelation, which seems to resolve it.

We spent a bunch of trouble looking into ways to preserve the scroll
position and other state across orientation changes, with mediocre
results.

Turns out the Browser app simply ensures that it preserves the activity
across orientation and screen size changes -- the webView naturally
keeps the correct scroll position across an orientation change if we
just let it be instead of recreating everything.

Note we may still need to preserve scroll position explicitly across
an activity being killed or something, so haven't removed that existing
code using the basic scrollY position.

Leaving it on for ICS and later, just disabling the autocomplete
on Gingerbread by not setting the adapter.

For some reason the autocomplete popup view crashes on
Gingerbread. This seems to be related to styles but I
can't quite figure out why.

This call in AutoCompleteTextView.buildDropDown ends up failing:

mDropDownList.setSelector(mDropDownListHighlight);

because mDropDownListHighlight seems to be null instead
of an expected drawable, and that ends up failing when used.

But the styles *look* ok, and I don't see any missing drawables
related to that style...

MobileFrontend changes that we depend on have not been deployed
yet. They are in master, and not even in 1.24wmf7. As a result
we get older styling for anything past the first page.

These changes will be in 1.24wmf8, which will be branched
on 5th June on to TestWiki, and will be on enwiki on
June 12th (according to
https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Deployments).
Setting this to 17th gves us a few more days to fix things
in the cluster before it goes live, if issues exist.

This removes the ability to modify the styles in place
for the first two weeks of the beta app release, but
I think that is better than broken styles or trying
to SWAT the MobileFrontend changes.

Images are stored in the same directory as the saved page.
No extra code for tracking needed, and better for consistency
vs. the database approach.
Another plus is that when we delete the saved page the
associated images are removed automatically.

Parsing of HTML is done using Html.fromHtml with a custom imageGetter.
This uses TagSoup internally, so no need to include an HTML parsing library.

When a saved page is loaded the img src URLs get replaced
by file URLs pointing to the saved image files.
