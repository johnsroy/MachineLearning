The namespace prefixed with 'tools' is stripped out by the compiler,

since it doesn't get included into the apk.

This is great for overriding or setting attributes just for the
IDE's layout preview/designer.

- Added DiskLruCache library to project (with license/credits, etc)
- The cache directory will automatically go to external storage (if
detected), or fall back to internal storage if no external card is

- Caching pages in key:value pairs where the key is an md5 of the page
title, and the value is a json dump of the Page object.
- The json structure of the Page object now includes the list of Gallery
items. However, this does not yet include the *full* set of information
for each Gallery item. This still has to be fetched from the network
when the user browses the Gallery activity. This will be addressed in a
future patch.
- When launching the Gallery activity, we are now passing it the original
page title (instead of the normalized title), since the original title
is the one that gets cached. The Gallery activity can then use the
cached page, based on the original title. However, this required a
slight modification to the API call that retrieves the collection of
images for the page, namely the inclusion of the 'redirects' parameter,
since generator=images doesn't work for page titles that are redirects,
and the 'redirects' parameter allows the API to automatically resolve
the redirect.
