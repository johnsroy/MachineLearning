When the Nearby activity resumes we still have the same
results, even if it was destroyed because of low memory.
This will make navigation easier since we don't automatically
change the list of results when the location changes.
If the user explicitly presses the refresh button or restarts
the activity then a new list of results will be retrieved.

NearbyResult is an object now, and parcelable.
Together with the locations (prev/next), it is stored in
a Bundle during onSaveInstanceSate;
to be used if the activity has to be recreated.

Gradle package (applicationId) rename:

Set Intent for AboutActivity in code vs preferences.xml
if a non-standard applicationId is used.

Uses AndroidManifest.xml snippets for every flavor
for the channel value, so no need to use the
prepare-release script for that and
for setting versionCode and versionName.

Added amazon flavor, removed master and ci.

Added new super-simple bump script which
increments the versionCode in the build.gradle file.

Added new make-release.py script which runs the
Gradle build and also provides a second step to
create and push the tags.

Removed the old scripts we don't use anymore.
