To create an image to be shared we create a new fixed size
Bitmap that is a bit taller than what we need.
We manually keep track of the vertical space (y) we draw on.
Once we're done drawing we adjust the height of the bitmap.

If we have a lead image, it goes on top,
followed by the title, an opening double quote sign,
then the text, and lastly the Wikipedia wordmark.

The lead image portion gets clipped and scaled to fit the width
of the screen. It's reusing the imageBaseYOffset for the face detection
adjustment and the Bitmap from LeadImageHandler.

The text goes through some minor regex replacements to get rid
of foot notes[1], remnants of IPAs, and spaces at beginning and end (trim).

If less than 6 characters remain then we don't do anything.
It is assumed that this rather arbitrary number is the absolute
minimum length of text in any language/character set to convey an idea/fact.

If the title or text is too long we first reduce the
font size. If that is not enough it gets ellipsized.

- The Gallery activity now has a ViewPager that hosts multiple fragments

- Moved PageCache to Wikipedia app, so that it's accesible by
GalleryActivity as well as PageActivity.
- The first time GalleryActivity is launched for a certain article, we
fetch a complete list of media items for the page. This list is then
cached, in case we launch the gallery again for the same page later.
- The ViewPager automatically pre-loads items to the immediate left and
right of the current item. This allows smooth swipes between adjacent
media items.
- The panning & zooming of the media items will still work. When the user
swipes the item past its edge, the swiping is passed to the ViewPager.

sharing another image.
Staying frugal with storage space, though, and make an effort to remove
any shared files once a day with a recurring task.

Now using Context.getExternalCacheDir() since
this folder would get automatically removed if the app is uninstalled.

Plus, checking first if ext. storage is writable before trying to write the file.
