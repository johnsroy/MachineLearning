It also fixes a crashing bug when long-pressing items in History or SavedPages

assigning a 'tag' to each different ActionMode, and the PageActivity now knows

To my knowledge there's no convenient way to find out if a string is missing a
translation into a particular language. For us this means that it's not easy
to check all of our strings and make sure they have documentation for our
translators. This patch adds a Python script that, when run, will tell you
what messages are undocumented.

don't even appear.

This patch marks username fields as visible password fields as a
workaround to both of the above.
