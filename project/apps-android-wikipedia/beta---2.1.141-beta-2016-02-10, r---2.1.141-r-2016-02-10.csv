This is now done the following way:

- When the lead image is shown, we constrain the height of the TextView
that holds the title+description, to fill the space between the top
toolbar and the bottom menu bar.

- When the lead image is not shown, we *unconstrain* the TextView height,
so that it's allowed to overflow the limit of some predefined fraction
of the screen height. The menu bar then naturally follows after the end
of the TextView. This is now also independent of landscape vs. portrait,
so I removed the landscape-specific dimen.

- Previously, we had some rather complicated code that automatically
resized the page title to fit within the lead image container. The thing
is, in all my time of using the app, I've never stumbled on an article
whose title needed to be resized this way (except deliberately). It
would make the code much less fragile to remove this part entirely, and
simply put a 'maxLines' limit on the page title.

let's take it out.
