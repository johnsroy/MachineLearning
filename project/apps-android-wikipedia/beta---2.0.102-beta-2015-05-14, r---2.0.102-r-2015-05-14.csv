This patch changes the app to run disambiguation links through a URL decoder,
and falls back to using the old system of displaying the encoded URL if
there's some problem with the decoding.

In some cases URL encoded links were shown to the user, which in the best
case just looks bad and is confusing, but in the worst case actually causes
the links to be incorrect and navigation to fail. This patch fixes that.

This patch implements a decodeURL method in Utils that uses URLDecoder to
decode a URL-encoded string into its UTF-8 equivalent, and then uses that
everywhere instead of directly using URLDecoder. This reduces code redundancy
and increases code cleanliness.

I'm proposing to include the versionCode into the version name format.
This will make version names more distinct, albeit for now there's a bit of redundancy.

Example:
2.0-beta-2015-04-09 becomes
2.0.100-beta-2015-04-09

I think eventually we could even consider getting rid of the date portion but
I'll keep it for now to make the transition smoother.

Had to also change the make-release.py script since it generated the version
name itself based on the date the command was run.
I'd like to get away from that and use the apk file to derive the version name.
It uses the versionCode from the build.gradle file.

To be able to extract the versionName from the apk it needs to know the location
of the aapt tool, which is under $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/<build_tools_version>.
Again, the build_tools_version is retrieved from the build.gradle file.
