Currently, switching the app language requires accessing the preferences screen
via the nav drawer and selecting the desired language from there.  That's
inconvenient when one is in the middle of something, a search for instance.

This patch puts a language selection button right on the search bar to make it
more convenient to change the app language on the fly.

- Add canonical app install ID and session token implementation to
Funnel.
- Use WikipediaApp.getPrimarySite() in Funnel when site is null.

The Funnel class hierarchy is one of the app's biggest DRY offenders
with many subclasses literally copying and pasting down to the
comments. As we have a sprint dedicated to event logging, it's long
overdue for refactoring.

Static analysis performed:
- Verify 'appInstallID' field with a value of
WikipediaApp.getAppInstallID(). If field has a different name,
override getAppInstallIDField(). If field has a different value,
override getAppInstallID(). If field does not exist, override
preprocessAppInstallID().
- Verify 'sessionToken' field with a value of
UUID.randomUUID().toString(). If field has a different name,
override getSessionTokenField(). If field has a different value,
override getSessionToken(). If field does not exist, override
preprocessSessionToken().
- Verify super.preprocessData(JSONObject) is called by Funnel
subclasses.
- Verify preprocessData(JSONObject, String, T) is called instead of
handling JSONExceptions.
- If Site is passed in the constructor, verify the super is invoked
with it.
- Verify all Funnel subclasses accounted for including TimedFunnel
descendents.
- Android Studio code inspection.

Functional analysis performed:
- All tests pass.
- Verify event logging on deployment-eventlogging02.eqiad.wmflabs for
each funnel except SessionFunnel which is unused.

TextInputLayout, as well as the EditText in the Captcha entry view, and
the edit preview summary.

Also made PlainPasteEditText inherit from AppCompatEditText, to make sure
that any styling that we apply to EditText in the future will be applied
properly by AppCompat.

Note: did *not* modify the EditText in the History and Saved Pages
fragments, since they're being affected by a known bug in AppCompat:

Once the above issue is fixed, we can finish those updates.

This patch does that.

Additionally, it removes a redundant snippet length check.

Changes in the API library mean that routine editing issues, such as blocks,

generic messages if they tried to edit while blocked, rather than a message
that told them they're blocked.

This patch updates the error handling by migrating checks for routine editing
issues to the onCatch method to handle them appropriately. Also removes the
EditingException class as it is no longer useful.

Here's the problem:
The width of the 'share as...' buttons is dictated by the width of the
preview image. The issue is that the preview image has a hard-coded width
in absolute pixels (not dp). Therefore, the image might appear larger on a
hdpi screen, or smaller on a xxhdpi screen.  When it appears smaller, it
causes the buttons to shrink, and thereby truncate the text of the
buttons, giving the user the impression that the buttons are identical.

This patch fixes the width and height of the ImageView used for displaying
the preview bitmap, so that it's displayed consistently on all display
densities, and makes the buttons sufficiently wide, as well.
