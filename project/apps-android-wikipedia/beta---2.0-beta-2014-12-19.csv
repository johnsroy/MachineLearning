The problem was that, even though the ViewHelper library (nineoldandroids)
correctly slides the lead image component, it does not successfully slide
the logical click area that corresponds to the visual position of the
component! So, the lead image remains 'clickable' even after sliding away.

The solution is to stop using the ViewHelper library, and shift the
position of the lead image component using standard margins.

There was another slight issue, however:  in Android 2.3, using negative
margins is only possible for a component that has a LinearLayout as a
parent.  So, I had to put the lead image container into a dummy
LinearLayout, just to achieve negative margins.

Thanks again, 2.3!

NOTE: The same issue is currently present in the Search bar at the top,
which slides away in a similar fashion. This will be the subject of a
subsequent patch.

In our LeadImagesHandler and BottomContentHandler, we use the
getFragment() function which returns the 'internal' fragment object that
is currently hosted by the PageViewFragment.  The problem is that, when a
PageViewFragment is detached, it sets its instance of the internal object
to null.  So, if the Lead or Bottom components try to access the internal
fragment using getFragment() from the result of an AsyncTask after the
parent fragment is detached, they will get a null pointer.

This patch refactors things so that the internal object itself is passed
to the Lead and Bottom components, so that they will never receive a null
reference to it.

For now, the inclusion of the UUID in other places not to be removed.

On the Android it platform it seems that per-funnel identifiers
are part of the event data itself, and as with iOS, the UUID is
constructed in a reliable manner.

For now the goal is to ensure the goal is to ensure the presence
of the accurately set X-WMF-UUID header without causing other
unintended side effects in the app.

It should be possible to query request logs once this code and its
counterpart, in the following change

, are both deployed. If the values match when expected to match,
then it should be possible to remove the request path UUID in other
non-event payload contexts (e.g., PageViewFragmentInternal.java's
builder object with parameter 'appInstallID').
