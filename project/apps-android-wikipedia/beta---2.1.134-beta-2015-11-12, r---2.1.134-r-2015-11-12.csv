* Use AndroidJUnitRunner for all Android instrumentation tests and add
androidTestCompile dependency[0]. This dependency includes JUnit 4,
among many other nice things.
* Remove dummy test calls to startActivity(). I believe these were added
as a workaround for using Activity test cases to exercise non-Activity
functionality. They are no longer needed with the new test runner and
actually cause it to fail assertions in
android.test.ActivityUnitTestCase.startActivity.

Currently, our PageActivity uses a translucent status bar, which appears
slightly darker than the toolbar color (which is correct). However, in our
other activities (Login, Edit, etc), the status bar color looks much
lighter than the toolbar, and is inconsistent.

This patch provides a color for the status bar that is set via styles.

When the app is launched via a VIEW intent (e.g. from an external
Browser), and it didn't have any tabs open from previous sessions, the app
unconditionally creates a new tab for the Main Page *and* a new tab for
the page requested in the VIEW intent, resulting in a puzzling appearance
of a new tab on top of a 'blank' tab.

This patch makes it so that the app creates a new tab only if the topmost
tab's backstack is nonempty. This successfully handles the case described
above.

-This required finding a way to prevent the custom CAB menu from
being injected during a long press in the search bar.  It turns out this
can happen because of new custom insertion action mode functionality
introduced in Marshmallow.  Unfortunately, the insertion/selection logic
is hidden entirely in private fields in the TextView class, and the
ActionMode API does not provide a way of finding the source view or action
triggering the action mode, nor whether the action mode is a selection
action mode or an insertion action mode.  So, (h/t @dbrant) I added a
getOriginatingView utility method to obtain the originating view of the
action mode by reflection.

-Additionally, updated the share-a-fact functionality to go through the
content provider framework on Marshmallow and above to prevent
permissions-related errors when sharing a fact as an image.[0]

This patch brings back obfuscation into our ProGuard configuration, since
this appears to be the only way to ensure that the offending class, namely
MenuBuilder, is renamed in the support.v7 library.

The library will soon be updated with MenuBuilder renamed internally, as
mentioned in the original Android bug:

https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=78377

...and we can investigate disabling obfuscation again at that juncture.

Fix the logic so the app always tries to load the requested page
by all means possible, so if the network connection is not
available it will try to fetch it from the cache or from the saved
pages storage. This patch changes a lot of code from the
JsonPageLoadStrategy, including the 'reload' logic.
The Link Previews are also modified so that if the preview
couldn't be retrieved from the network but there is a
cached version of the page in the device, the link preview
will be constructed from the page contents.
