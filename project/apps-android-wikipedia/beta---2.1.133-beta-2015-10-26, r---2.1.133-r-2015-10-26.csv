The HTML for references has changed to use a different CSS rule with Parsoid: <span class='mw-ref'> vs. <sup> in mobileview.
I found the CSS rules through:
view-source:https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/page/html/Cat
<link rel='stylesheet' href='//en.wikipedia.org/w/load.php?modules=mediawiki.legacy.commonPrint,shared|mediawiki.skinning.elements|mediawiki.skinning.content|mediawiki.skinning.interface|skins.vector.styles|site|mediawiki.skinning.content.parsoid|ext.cite.style&amp;only=styles&amp;skin=vector'/>
--> https://en.wikipedia.org/w/load.php?debug=true&modules=ext.cite.style&amp;only=styles&amp;skin=vector
--> https://en.wikipedia.org/static/1.27.0-wmf.3/extensions/Cite/modules/ext.cite.style.css
So, I had to add 'ext.cite.style' to the list of modules to be loaded.
Will see if we can make that an automatic dependency in mw-vagrant.
In the meantime you should enabled the role 'cite' as well.

ProGuard'd builds are no longer obfuscated so mapping.txt is no longer
generated. Remove the mapping archival step from make-release.py.

* Fix HockeyApp ProGuard rules. The old rules don't seem to work any
more. Blanket keep all in the HockeyApp package.
* Check for crashes in PageActivity. When transmission of the crash
report fails in CrashReportActivity, the report lingers until the next
check. Always check in PageActivity so we get reports as soon as
possible.
