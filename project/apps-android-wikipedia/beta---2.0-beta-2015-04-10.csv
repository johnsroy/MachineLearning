Since the captcha form requires only a single input (i.e. the captcha),
this patch makes the enter key on the keyboard submit the form rather
than simply collapsing the keyboard.

This patch also slightly tweaks the ordering of the XML for the captcha
group, so that the android:id is at the top, which is our prevailing
style.

Use the same solution used to solve this as we did in the past. It's a

The issue was that the article in question had a very short first paragraph,
which caused us to move the next-longest paragraph to the top, which made
the article look out-of-sequence.

We should make sure to further test whether our method still works for the
articles for which it's intended to work, as well as articles with a very
short first sentence,

I needed something menial to do to relax, so here it is. I reordered a ton of
the XML so that the android:id is almost always on top, and separated out some
attributes so that they're on multiple lines. There should be no user-facing
changes as a result of this, but it lets new developers easier find the ID of
a view at a glance.
