See also the additions in the README.mediawiki file.

Note that it requires the Android SDK package
extra-android-m2repository to be installed locally.

Added flavors for dev, ci, master, beta, prod
It automatically replaces the app icon and app label
for beta.

Added signing config for release builds.
To make release builds work:
Copy the signing.properties.sample file to
~/.sign/signing.properties and adjust the values.

What doesn't work yet?
[] instrumentationTest don't get picked up
[] I commented out the Gradle applicationId rename
since that currently requires some backwards-
incompatible changes. Will provide a separate
[WIP] patch for that. We also have that functionality
covered by our prepare-release.py script.
