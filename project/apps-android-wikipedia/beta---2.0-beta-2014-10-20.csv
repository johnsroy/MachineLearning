- The PageViewFragment now sits in a simple container in PageActivity, and
can be replaced with other Fragments (will lead to Fragment-izing the
rest of our Activities)
- The PageViewFragment is now a light container for the heavier
PageViewFragmentInternal object. When a PageViewFragment goes in the
backstack of the FragmentManager, the 'internal' object can be fully
disposed, thus allowing a large number of fragments in the backstack.
- Added a PageCache class, where Page objects are cached upon visiting new
pages (Page objects are no longer written to savedInstanceState). In the
future, the PageCache may be written/read from storage across app
restarts.
- Improved pre-scrolling to a specific offset when going 'back', by
scrolling as soon as the section with that offset is loaded.

- Things launched from the Nav menu are now Fragments that replace each

- Made full-text search into a Fragment
- Made the PageActivity have a real ActionBar (to be built out in the next
patch), into which the actions of the fragments are added.
- Made sure that savedInstanceState preserves the order of the fragment
backstack.
- Login activity to be dealt with in another patch...
