One of the latest crash reports relating to Gson unmarshalling has yielded
something revealing: the PageProperties object contains a private instance
of a SimpleDateFormat object which, when marshalled, takes up a *lot* of
unnecessary space, and may possibly be contributing to errors when it's
unmarshalled.

This patch removes the SimpleDateFormat object from PageProperties, and
moves it to WikipediaApp (into a method that returns a new instance of
SimpleDateFormat for every call, since SimpleDateFormat is not
thread-safe), making it accessible to any PageProperties instance, and
helps to optimize the marshalling of the app's tab/backstack state.

* Add a public keystore and properties to repo.

The name 'repo' is used to avoid confusion with build flavors, build
types, and key types. i.e., the repo keystore is applicable to more
than the dev flavor, so don't call it 'dev', more than the debug build
type, so don't call it 'debug', and like any keystore, contains both
public and private keys so don't call it 'public'.

Properties could be hardcoded in Groovy, but a properties file allows
for homogeneous handling of both repo and prod signing configurations.

* Change signing configurations:

* Override signingConfigs.debug to use repo. It is a little confusing
to call the repo signing configuration 'debug' but we don't want the
implicit debug configuration leaking in. The alternative is to have
a dummy or redundant debig configuration, each of which is unhappy.

* Always use repo keystore for debug build types, and dev and alpha
flavors. Always use prod keystore for all other release flavors. For
dev and alpha builds, that means signatures are tied to package
names not build types. e.g., you can install a dev release build on
top of a dev debug build without uninstalling.

A dev keystore is recommend by Jake Wharton[0]. Using this keystore
for alpha builds as well keeps security concerns out of our Jenkins
alpha job.

* Dev and alpha builds have a new signature. Previously distributed
dev and alpha builds must be uninstalled which will cause data loss.

* Everyone can install each others' apps without uninstalling.

* Use lowercase.dot instead of UPPERCASE_SNAKE for keystore pre-dex properties.

UPPERCASE_SNAKE seems unconventional[0].

[0] https://android.googlesource.com/platform/build/+/master/tools/buildinfo.sh

TODOs once merged:

* Send courtesy announcement alerting users that an alpha uninstall is
necessary.

* Update locale ~/.sign/signing.properties.

- LinkPreviewDialog makes full use of SwipeableBottomDialog.
- Created a custom View called GalleryThumbnailScrollView, which inherits
from RecyclerView (finally), and implements a horizontally-scrollable
gallery of image thumbnails.
- Modified GalleryCollectionFetchTask to be able to fetch thumbnail URLs
for each gallery item, which is specified conditionally. The full-size
gallery works as before, while the thumbnail gallery uses the new
modified fetching parameters.
- Clicking on any of the scrollable thumbnail images leads to the full
Gallery with that image focused.
- Increased the global preferred thumbnail size to 320, which will
increase the fidelity of thumbnail images shown in Search results,
History, Saved Pages, Nearby, and Link Preview thumbnails.

Temporarily revert string resource key names made in
aca6ca981dca276c0f57d17768085bde5583c052. String contents may change,
or strings added or removed, but string names must remain the same so
TWN diffs may be resolved safely.

Let this be a lesson in keeping patches small and a tale of caution that
our translation diffs aren't terribly sophisticated. Devs may
exclusively change string names or values in patch and in a day.

The following reverts were made according to strings.xml[0]:

menu_page_save                     -> menu_save_page
menu_page_share                    -> menu_share_page
snackbar_saving_page               -> toast_saving_page
snackbar_saved_page_format         -> toast_saved_page
snackbar_saved_page_missing_images -> toast_saved_page_missing_images
snackbar_refresh_saved_page        -> toast_refresh_saved_page
snackbar_saved_page_deleted        -> toast_saved_page_deleted
menu_page_other_languages          -> menu_other_languages
menu_page_find_in_page             -> find_in_page
menu_page_font_and_theme           -> menu_themechooser
menu_page_show_tabs                -> menu_show_tabs
menu_long_press_open_page          -> menu_open_link
menu_long_press_open_in_new_tab    -> menu_open_in_new_tab

Prior to this patch, the behavior when selecting the Share option from the
overflow menu was to launch the Share-a-fact dialog with the first
paragraph of text. But in fact, all that users really want is to share the
URL of the page. At the time of this writing, this is one of the most
requested features to be brought back.

Special pages are not supported by the mobileview API (that's
why we bounce them to an external browser in the app), and
References are external links by definition. Therefore, it's
meaningless to offer to open these links in a new tab.

- The title is now clickable (Materially), and goes to the target article.
- Removed the thumbnail image next to the title.
- Removed dark background from title & overflow button.
- Removed the persistent button on top of the preview, and moved it to the
bottom of the content, as it was originally. (And therefore removed the
'overlay' view code)
- The bottom button is now Material-styled.
- Reduced the TextExtract length to 2 sentences, as it was before.
- Made the TextExtract receiver more fault-tolerant (optString instead of
getString)
- Updated the image gallery Funnel to track whether it was entered via the
link preview (in addition to Lead Image vs. non-lead image). (The schema
already supports this generalization)
- Brought back client-side processing of sentences from the TextExtract.
(Sorry to flip-flop on this, but additional testing of this
functionality has convinced me that it really is better this way. Once
we transition to the content service, we can take this out.)
- An executive decision to refer to articles as 'articles' in this
instance (Design and mgt. are in agreement).

This reverts commit 1fe3e21d5efaa350e38722f3db15672f56bd99d7.

Looks like java-mwapi structure (Api, RequestBuilder, etc.) is not a good fit for dealing with REST endpoints. Looking into other options, like Retrofit instead.

naturally.
- ...except in History and Saved Pages, where we need to explicitly apply
the background selector to the items, so that the 'activated' state can
be applied (we use the activated state to indicate multiple selections).
- Updated the colors in the custom selectable_item_background selector to
match the default AppCompat colors.

- All users get link previews.
- Removed the LinkPreviewVersion randomizer, and bumped the version number
in the Funnel to 3, to distinguish the new events from the previous
events, which had version 0, 1, or 2. (Also removed the link preview
version preference)
- Some final (really) padding/margin tweaks in the xml layout.
- Removed the subtle zoom animation that gets applied to the background
activity when the link preview is shown. On two of my devices (API 18
and 19), and on API 19 in the emulator, the link preview seemed to
consume a nontrivial amount of CPU (even when idle!) when displayed on
top of a zoomed-out activity. When the activity is not zoomed out, CPU
consumption is normal. Until we figure out why this happens, let's just
not do the animation.

A bug in HHVM, T109402, causes most of the line endings to disappear in
translations. After exporting from TWN, the following approximate
commands were executed to printy print the XML:

find -name strings.xml|
grep -Ev values/strings.xml|
xargs -rd\\n -I{} sh -c 'xmllint --format '$1' -o '$1'' -- '{}'

TranslationTests.testAllTranslations() failed because a format specifier
was added to one string. This failure is a false positive as it is
always safe to add a format specifier, but not usually safe to remove
one without updating all translations since the argument would not be
supplied in the Java code. As a workaround, the tests pass after
running:

find -name strings.xml|
grep -Ev 'values/|-qq/'|
xargs -rd\\n  sed -ri 's%<string name='toast_saved_page'[^>]*>[^<]*</string>%%'
