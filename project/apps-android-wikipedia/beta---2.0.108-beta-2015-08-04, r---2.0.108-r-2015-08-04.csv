The updated Android Studio saves HPROF dumps and allocation traces to a
directory called /captures, which should not be relevant for git.

If you make a mistake when typing in your password, it's nice to have a 'Show
password' check box so you don't have to retype your entire password (which
would be quite the inconvenience on a mobile device if you have a long
password). This patch implements that, and it was super simple to do due to a
provided convenience method in Utils! :-)

In my previous patch, I incorrectly made PageActivity open pages in a new
tab that came from the ACTION_PAGE_FOR_TITLE intent. This includes
interlanguage links, file page links invoked from GalleryActivity, and
EditActivity results.

This patch reverts that change, and corrects the behavior.

- Catch errors during tab unmarshalling and report them. For non-prod
builds, the user is prompted via ACRA. For prod builds, exceptions are
printed to logcat.
- Light clean up of Gson classes.

Gson can throw more than JsonSyntaxException. This patch adds a safety
mechanism for catching any Exception produce during unmarshalling of
tabs and reports it.

This patch standardizes the long-press action for our WebView and
ListViews to use a standard ContextMenu (which pops up in the center of
the screen), instead of a custom PopupMenu. This makes it consistent with
other apps that implement long-pressing within a WebView, as well as
significantly simplifies the overall logic. As a bonus, this also makes
long-pressing on links work correctly in ICS.
