Use wprov=sfia1 for image card sharing
The Android app doesn't use the URL when sharing as text.
So, nothing to do there.

Our search experience provides the user with prefix-search and full-text
search results. However, in the case of prefix-search results, if the
result is a Redirect page, it may be more useful to the user to see the
*target* of the redirect, rather than the redirect name itself.  In
addition, the redirect (source) page doesn't come with a thumbnail or
pageterms, which is even less useful to the user.

This patch enables automatic resolving of redirects for prefix-search,
whereby the target of the redirect will be shown, complete with thumbnail
and description. This is accomplished in a slightly roundabout way:
- The search API allows us to specify 'redirects=true' to automatically
resolve redirects. Simple enough...
- However, when we receive the results, any result that is a redirect
target will no longer have the 'index' property, which we use to sort
the results in our list.
- However, the query response also contains a separate 'redirects' array
that contains a list of all the redirected results, apparently in the
correct order.
- So first, I take all the results that have an 'index' property, and
make a list of the 'holes' in the indices. I then fill the holes with
the results that don't have an 'index' property, in the order that they
appear in the 'redirects' list!

This can be vastly simplified, of course, if the API includes the 'index'
property with the redirected results. However, this may be difficult to do
on the API side, so this will have to be the solution for now.

The plan so far:
- PageViewFragmentInternal shall now become a true Fragment (and
I've deleted the 'old' PageViewFragment class).  Once this patch
is merged, we can rename it back to PageViewFragment. I'm not
renaming it yet, to better keep track of what is changing.
- The new fragment structure of the main activity shall be: a single
PageViewFragment (to display n pages), and at most one other fragment
on top of it (History, Saved Pages, Nearby) for selecting pages to
navigate to.
- Added additional sequencing logic to async tasks that fetch page
content, so that they correctly invalidate themselves when a new page is
loaded.

TODO: Perform some additional profiling, and see if there are any
remaining resource leaks.
