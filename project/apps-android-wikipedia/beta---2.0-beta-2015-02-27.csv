Refactored the way we initialize and clean up our ShareAdapters (both the
TextSelected and NoTextSelected adapters).
They were being instantiated in-place, and were creating Dialog objects
that weren't being destroyed properly upon screen rotation (leaking the
window).  This was also causing an imbalance in the adding and removing of
the Clipboard Listener that receives the shared text from the WebView,
which was preventing the text from being shared after rotation.

I modified the ShareAdapters to inherit from the base ShareHandler, which
will maintain a reference to the Dialog that it instantiates, so that it
can be explicitly dismissed when necessary.  And the Clipboard listener
will now persist for the lifetime of the Activity.

If a media item explicitly licensed under CC (any variation), then show

Clicking on the icon will launch the associated license URL in the

Long-pressing the icon will pop up a Toast with the UsageTerms for the

The last modified time is always wrong, because the contents of the main page
are contained inside another template. This patch simply hides the message. An
alternative would've been to hack it to always say that it was modified today,
but that could be wrong on wikis where the main page content isn't updated
daily.

This patch also adds isFilePage() and isMainPage() methods to the Page class
for convenience. It was quite clunky to remember that you needed to
getPageProperties().isMainPage() and getTitle.isFilePage(), so this alleviates
you having to do that if you have the Page object. A subsequent patch can
migrate places where the old way is used to the more convenient way.

This patch:

* Changes the Java that receives disambiguation links to process the href

* Modifies DisambigListAdapter to use display titles rather than ugly ones
* Modifies the task that fetches descriptions to also work with display titles

All in all, disambiguation links that point to a specific section now work.

The onStop event is too 'early' for unregistering the clipboard listener.
It's possible to go to another activity (e.g. gallery), then come back,
and suddenly be unable to share highlighted text. This is because the
activity was stopped (onStop) and then resumed.

The onDestroy event is called when the activity will definitely not be
resumed. Dismissing the sharing dialogs inside this event is OK, too.
