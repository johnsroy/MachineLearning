Currently we flip the icons for Twitter, Facebook, and Messaging. As noted
in T109209, this does not make sense. This patch deletes the RTL icons for
those social networks, so that the same, standard icon is used in both LTR
and RTL, and marks the SVGs that generate those icons as noflip, so that RTL
versions are never generated.

We can't improve what we don't measure.
I'm adding some performance tests to see how long loading a few pages
on testwiki takes. It's good to have those tests added before we significantly
change the page load code further.
For serious testing increase the NUM_RUNS to a higher value.
Also to compare apples to apples it's imperative to test on the same devices,
ideally with the same network condition.
(Ok, the latter is not really exactly controlled. But as long as we're talking
about a stable broadband connection it should be good enough.
The alternative would be mocking responses from a Mock MediaWiki server
and injecting code to use that instead of the real servers.)

Introduced a callback for page load completion which is currently only
used for this performance test but could be used for other things in the future.

Renamed another test to make it clearer that it's testing SectionFetchTask directly.

When showing the Wikipedia Zero banner from PageActivity, we were
anchoring the SnackBar to a View that's only available when a PageFragment
is active. Therefore, when a different fragment is active (e.g. History),
the view doesn't exist, and thus causes a crash.

This updates the code to use a more generic View from the current Activity
for displaying the banner.

This can potentially happen when the task that fetches a Random title
takes a long time, and the PageActivity is stopped in the meantime (this
can be reproduced by adding a delay to RandomArticleIdTask, and checking
'Don't keep activities' in Settings).

Since the task to retrieve a Random title is asynchronous, it means that
the PageActivity might become closed before the task is finished. However,
upon finishing the task, we unconditionally call displayNewPage(),
expecting the activity to be active all the time.

In API 17+ there is a function called Activity.isDestroyed() that can be
used for this purpose, but there's no equivalent function for earlier
APIs... Therefore I added our own isDestroyed() method to our base
Activity class, ThemedActionBarActivity.

locally and that should be the only image considered. For this reason,
srcsets are now removed when remapping the remote image URLs to local
files. Additionally, this transformation is now performed after all
sections are loaded to avoid a race condition prevalent in long
