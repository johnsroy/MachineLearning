-Simplified Chinese (HANS)
-Traditional Chinese (HANT)
* However, it is probably worth keeping generic Chinese because:
-HANS/HANT choice may be too generic for user with special dialect.
-If this patch solves the problem, it's less work for users.
* Another follow on patch should address locales at large:
-We should first see if this Chinese patch is good enough for ZH.
-Some languages using Cyrillic alphabet have a similar issue
-We should solve for same language, different locale LTR/RTL stuff.
