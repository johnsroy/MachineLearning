The keyboard wasn't always showing when this method was called because it used
SHOW_IMPLICIT instead of SHOW_FORCED. This should fix a few bugs relating to
the keyboard not showing.

when uprev is True
Also change versionName in repo to just say 'dev' to avoid
confusion about old versionNames in master

Also dropped the 'tagged_' prefix of the tags, so it's
just 'releases/*' instead of 'tagged_releases/*'
