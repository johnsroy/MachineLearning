The issue was that the addition of 'morelike' searching didn't
differentiate between searching from the Search bar, and searching for
Read More suggestions. The 'morelike' search, if enabled, should only
apply to Read More suggestions.

Therefore, this patch adds a parameter to the full-text search task to
specify whether to perform a 'morelike' search, which the Search bar now
explicitly sets to false.

This cannot be easily reproduced but according to the stack trace this happens
when backStack == null during onSaveInstanceState.
This patch set the back stack to an empty list right in the JsonPageLoadStrategy constructor. While it seems a bit wasteful since it should get set later anyways it's probably the safer thing to do.
