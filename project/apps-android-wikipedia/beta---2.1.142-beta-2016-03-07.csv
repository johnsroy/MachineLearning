So, it looks like the Fresco repo contains a 'samples' directory that
contains a 'ZoomableDraweeView' that precisely suits our needs.
https://github.com/facebook/fresco/tree/master/samples/zoomable

Unfortunately, this is not yet part of the packaged distribution of
Fresco, so we need to package it ourselves for now, and keep an eye out
for updates.

-Reduced zero banner size/text size
-Add link to banner when bannerUrl setting is present

Also includes substantial refactoring of the Zero-related code for

Note: EL as implemented here deviates slightly from schema in returning

A small number of Zero operators whitelist only certain language wikis.
This action logs when a user is not shown an exit interstitial despite
being potentially zero-rated based on IP address because the specific wiki
the user was on was in a non-zero-rated language.

An example of this is when a user is on a network owned by a provider that
zero-rates only English and French Wikipedias, and is browsing German
Wikipedia and clicks an external link.

This is a tentative implementation of the extlink-always action in

Apparently, in the exit intertitial dialog on the mobile web, there was
once an option to suppress further warnings and always continue.  I think
this is what Yuri had in mind when creating the schema.  But I can't
replicate that behavior.

If we decide to include such an option in our exit warning dialog, we can
log this action there, too, but manually switching off the warnings in the
settings also seems like an action that meets the criteria for logging
extlink-always.

• Reduce ambiguity by renaming members to match URL syntax

preview=1 is set whenever the summary endpoints are used
pageview=1 is set whenever the lead section requests are used

This is done for both MW API and RESTBase endpoints.
For the MW API we need to add it to the lead section request since the
Analytics Refinery uses the legacy lead section requests.
(We don't want to count both the lead section request and the remaining
section request as separate pageviews.)
For consistency sake I did the same for the RESTBase case, even though
there it's not strictly required.
