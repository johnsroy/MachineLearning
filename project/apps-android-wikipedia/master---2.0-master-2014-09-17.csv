* Add support and messages for five more errors the API can give you.
* Differentiate between IP blocks and account blocks when presenting messages
to the user.
* Change ordering of error presentation so that if there are multiple errors
then the user is told about the unresolvable ones first so that they don't
jump through hoops trying to fix the errors if they'd never be able to anyway
(e.g. if they're blocked, don't tell them their password is too short first,
just tell them they're blocked).

I hope the translators get this right for RTL vs LTR.

The only way to get this to appear again after it was acknowledged

There was a bug that it still showed the ToC intro when one
pressed on the Got it button but used the ToC action
bar button to open the ToC again.

Also adjusting the size of the hand swipe image to be smaller
for devices with smaller height, so that the Got it button fits
on the screen. Unfortunately, when orientation is changed
it doesn't update since we still using the orientation hack in the
AndroidManifest. So, when changing from portrait to landscape
there is still a chance that the button would be hidden but
switching back to portrait would fix this.

but it always ends up calling the super's log method. However, the code looks
confusing and doesn't make that obvious.

This patch adds the super keyword before every call to the parent's log
function, for clarity. Some classes already had the keyword in there, but this
patch adds it to the rest. The actual functionality before and after this patch
should be exactly the same.
