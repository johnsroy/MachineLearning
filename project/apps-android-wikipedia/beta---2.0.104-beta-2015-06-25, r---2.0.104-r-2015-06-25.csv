Recently some more standardised sampling logic was added to the Funnel class,
so that child classes didn't have to reimplement it, which reduces code
duplication. Most classes were switched over to this, but ToCInteractionFunnel
still uses the old sampling method. It should be migrated to the new version.

This patch unifies the TextSelected and NoTextSelected handlers, since
both are now using the same call to the Bridge to retrieve selected text
inside the WebView.

In the case of no text highlighted, we switch to fetching the actual
content of the first <p> element from the WebView, instead of extracting
the HTML in Java. This also makes it consistent with iOS.
