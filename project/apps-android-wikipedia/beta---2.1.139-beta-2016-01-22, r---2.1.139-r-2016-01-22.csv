Share-a-fact cards were no longer showing the background image correctly
because the underlying ImageView is now using a Matrix transform to
achieve the parallax effect, and it becomes incorrectly applied to the
share-a-fact card.

This patch simplifies things by letting the share-a-fact card access the
underlying Bitmap of the ImageView, instead of making the ImageView draw
itself onto a new Bitmap.

In the previous implementation, I see there was some concern regarding a
possible exception due to using a recycled bitmap, but I don't see how
this can happen, given our current way of drawing the card.

EditTaskTest
• Fix testAbuseFilterTriggerWarn(). This requests exercises a warning,
not an error. A second request will succeed or stimulate the warning.
Now the test makes a second request as needed.
• There appears to still be one lingering and very rare bug around
tokens in testAbuseFilterTriggerStopOnArbitraryErrorCode(), possibly
T89702. The error message is, 'badtoken: Invalid token'. This may be
addressed when more information is available.
• Remove token storage interaction. testEdit() was the only client
actually using the token from storage and that token was cleared
before access so the anonymous user token (+\) was always returned.
Tokens are a separate concern and should be tested elsewhere.
• Improve the testing DSL by extracting subject usage to a private
subclass that owns threading. This concern obscured the intent of the
tests with copious boilerplate. Additionally, move common default
values into the subclass.
• Require that the response of testCaptcha() be a CaptchaResult, not a
SuccessEditResult. This test always seems to produce CaptchaResult
responses.
• In testEdit(), verify edit success by checking the instanceof result
instead of the result code magic string.
• In testEdit(), when the service indicates success, don't re-fetch the
wikitext and verify the result. This is the concern of the service.
• In testEdit(), don't try to handle the exceptional case of the test
running at the same time elsewhere. None of EditTaskTest tests play
nicely when run in parallel.

EditTokenStorage
• Replace reference to implementation with reference to interface.

• Don't mix login and anonymous edit tokens in EditTaskTest. Since
cookies are merged across domains, each test case now just clears all
cookies. This was the behavior of the test last year. However, it was
modified to be more exact by limiting the domain which introduced the
subtle bug of including the login session token.

• Fix SharedPreferenceCookieManager.clearCookiesForDomain() to clear in
memory cookies for the given domain. Previously this only updated
nonvolatile storage.
