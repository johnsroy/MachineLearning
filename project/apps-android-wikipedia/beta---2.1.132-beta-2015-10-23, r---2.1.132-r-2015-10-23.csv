This was an experiment to try to improve the readability of the first
sentence of the article, which often contains information in parentheses.
But, since the (relatively naive) algorithm for removing parentheses also
affects links that have parentheses in them, this was doing more harm than
good by breaking these links.

Note: we are still stripping parenthetical content from link previews, but
that's because we don't enable links within the preview. If we end up
enabling links in the preview, then we'll need to revisit this issue.

Syntax highlighting when editing wikitext in the app has been available
for over a year, but has so far been disabled, in the hopes of coming up
with an entirely transformative editing experience in the app. Since we
haven't created such an experience just yet, presenting the user with
modestly highlighted wikitext is better than a solid wall of unhighlighted
wikitext.

The TextExtracts extension returns content from the lead section of the
requested article. It allows the caller to specify a certain number of
sentences, or a certain number of characters, to retrieve from the lead
section.  But what if the caller requests more data than is present in the
lead section?

Well, in the case of 'sentences', the extension correctly returns the
maximum number of available sentences in the lead section, and no more.
However, in the case of 'characters', it actually goes beyond the lead
section, and appends content from subsequent sections, which might include
unparsed wikitext (e.g. section headings, edit link, etc).

Previously, we were requesting 512 characters, so that we can parse them
ourselves into two intelligible sentences based on the user's Locale.
This patch changes it to use 'sentences': We ask for 10 sentences, and
then re-parse the text using our sentence parsing logic to end up with 2
sentences.

Why do we trust our sentence parsing logic more than TextExtracts? Because
it's better-tailored to the user's Locale on the client side. For example,
in the case of English, the TextExtracts extension incorrectly treats
abbreviations like 'i.e.', 'B.C.', 'Jr.', etc. as separate sentences,
whereas our parser will leave those alone.

In the interest of avoiding extra finger work and more sophisticated UI,
remove the system language switch and implicitly enable or disable 'use
system language' according to the app language entry selected and
the actual system language.

This change might cause confusion for a very small percentage of use
cases. For example, if the user picks Japanese and that language happens
to be the system language, the app language will be implicitly set to
follow the system language, indicated by the special language key value
of null. If the user then leaves the app and changes the system language
to Russian and reenters the app, they're either pleased to see that the
app language automatically updated to Russian without having to wonder
what 'system language' meant in the first place OR they're confused and
reset the app language to Japanese again. Thereafter, they never have to
reset the app language even if they change the system language. The
first step is actually unnecessary to arrive at this dilemma since the
initial language is the system language. Despite this potential
confusion, we believe this change will provide the best experience for
most users.

- Added a new source, to represent pages viewed from the disambiguation

- The funnel now also records the average latency of the lead section

records whether the request is done via the MediaWiki API, or the new

* Replace ACRA with HockeyApp v3.5.0. This change was made as ACRA
doesn't offer in itself a freestanding backend or quiet automatic
reporting, and doesn't support Marshmallow yet[0]. However, we will
investigate a self-hosted Acralyzer installation in the future.

HockeyApp doesn't seem to offer custom properties, so these are
bundled as JSON in the report description. Since these properties are
not associated with a crash instance and not preserved across
application death, and crashes may enqueue, it's possible they may be
inaccurate. However, these properties are used in one place presently
and the current implementation _should_ be adequate.

The ProGuard rules were updated for HockeyApp from this document[1]
and a little guesswork.

HockeyApp v3.5.0 seems to be incompatible with Marshmallow just like
ACRA. v3.6.0-b.1 appears to work fine. The upgrade will be made in a
subsequent patch with related changes.

The change in APK size is ~13 KiB. More specifically, the release
application was 3825548 B previously and 3838973 B after, increasing
by 13425 B.

Crash reporting was verified on dev debug, and alpha, beta, and prod
release configurations on API 15:

gradlew clean installDevDebug installAlphaRelease installBetaRelease installProdRelease

Smoke test crash reporting was verified with HockeyApp v3.6.0-b.1 on
Marshamallow (with changes coming in a subsequent patch).

A future patch may replace alpha distribution with HockeyApp.

* Add remote logger to L in the form of logRemoteErrorIfProd(Throwable).
This is meant to coincide with cludge fixes where the error path is
not understood. This is done via a helper Exception,
RemoteLogException, which supplies an accurate stacktrace by forcing
creation at the point of logging. In the event that a build is non-
production, L will throw the Throwable, causing the app to crash. The
thinking was that if it's worth burning user data and engineering
parsing time, it's worth crashing on everything but prod. A new UI was
added to dev settings to test this functionality, save the non-prod
crash bit.

Also replace Exception logging functions with Throwables and fix no
message overloads to print an empty string instead of null for their
messages.

* Rename acra_report_dialog_title and acra_report_dialog_text to
crash_report_dialog_title and crash_report_dialog_text. Remove
acra_report_dialog_comment Strings as in-app feedback was removed:

find -name strings.xml|
xargs -rd\\n sed -ri '/<string name='acra_report_dialog_comment'[^>]*>[^<]*<\/string>/d'

* Extremely light refactoring of PreferenceLoader and related classes to
expose the host Activity, needed by HockeyApp, and a
findPreference(int) overload that accepts a key String resource ID.

* Replace the crash test NullPointerException with a dummy
TestException.

The new convention to store the launcher icon of an android app is to use
the res/mipmap-{...} folders (for example, res/mipmap-xhdpi/launcher.png,
res/mipmap-xxhdpi/launcher.png, and so on). The images in those directories
won't be erased by the most common APK optimization tools (those tools usually
generate a different APK for each display density, and so they remove all the
images under res/drawable-{...} with a density different than the specified).
Since launcher icons can be displayed at a different density than the
device density, it's best practice to put them into the mipmap directories.
