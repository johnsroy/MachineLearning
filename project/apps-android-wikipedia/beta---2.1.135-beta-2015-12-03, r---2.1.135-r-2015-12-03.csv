The parallax effect used by the lead image was accomplished by sizing
its housing ImageView to the full dimensions of the image and then
translating the View itself to achieve a parallax effect. This was nice
because it avoided math and translations are cheap but poor because it
changed layout parameters without concern for adjacent Views. This
unusual behavior made it difficult to visualize the View hierarchy.

This patch moves the parallax effect from raw View resizing and
translations to the ImageView's Drawable matrix. The math is a little
intimidating in some parts, but it's mostly pure (free of implementation
details), and the View is now boring and predictable. This change will
make it easy to add or remove Views without surprising things happening.

This patch includes somewhat of a redesign, or more accurately a bit of a
stripdown of the interface, compared with the previous design. This will
now be a simple full-screen map with markers. Clicking on a marker brings
up a link preview for the given article. Nice and simple.
This means that the 'list' interface with accelerometer-based arrows has

Also updated the marker image that pinpoints to articles on the map.

This adds a thumbnail to the default link preview layout, to make it
consistent with other instances where we have a page title and a
thumbnail. Also a few minor design tweaks:
- Added a subtle gray divider between the title and extract text.
- Sightly reduced the font size of the title text, now that there's less
horizontal space because of the thumbnail.
- Increased the maximum lines for the title text to 3.

This adds a button to 'Get directions' to the link preview that pops up
when tapping on a map marker. The button fires an Intent with a 'geo:' Uri
that should be picked up by the default Maps app installed on the device.

Note: this patch does not implement the 'Get directions' menu item in the
link preview's overflow menu (to be shown when the link preview is invoked
from a regular link in an article that has a location). This will be done
in a subsequent patch.

- Only clear results when the query changes and the new result set is
received.
- Add @Nullable / @NonNull annotations where obvious.

The search results Fragment has several sources of input including:

1 Prefix search
2 Full text search
3 Search suggestion
4 Cache

There are special cases but the primary flow intents for starting a new
search (whenever query changes) appear to be:

1 Search term is identical: do nothing.
2 Search term is empty: clear results.
3 Cache is nonempty: clear old results and show new.
4 Cache is empty: perform a prefix and suggestion search.
5 Prefix and suggestions search was nonempty: clear old results and show
new, clear or show the search suggestion too.
6 Prefix and suggestions search was empty: clear or show suggestion and
perform a full text search.
7 Full text search completed: clear old results and show any new.

Additionally, when the end of the results list is scrolled to, full text
searches are performed and the results are appended. This seems to have
been the source of the issue as results were being cleared instead of
appended, so the user was always at the bottom of the list and always
triggering another search.
