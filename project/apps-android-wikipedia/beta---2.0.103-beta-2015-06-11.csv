Presently the app uses System.currentSystemMillis() to measure time
intervals. This method is subject to changes in the system clock, which can
throw off time measurements rather substantially. This patch changes
SearchResultsFragment to use System.nanoTime() instead, which is not subject
to changes in the system clock and actually has a higher level of precision
anyway. This should fix the issue where some search result sets were
allegedly being displayed many days before the user even typed the query in.

The main change is really a refactor/splitting up of PageViewFragmentInternal,
so we can easily switch between the two page load strategies:
the old one is JSON based,
the new one is HTML based via WebView.loadUrl().

You can switch between the page load strategies by checking the
CheckBox at the bottom of the Theme chooser dialog.
The transition between the two strategies is not ideal since it
doesn't automatically reload the page, but good enough for
occasional/experimental switching.
(The old strategy has an explicit backstack we maintain, the new one doesn't.)
A page refresh right after this will crash the app.
Better use load a new page instead (Today, Random,  search, ...)

Warning: there may still be some crashes while using the experimental mode.
Using the regular page load mode should behave as it did before.

Issue was caused by my earlier patch Ibf571c12f6d462f63cac1db52e30ad17a7215a59.

The backstack was not retained since it got moved to JsonPageLoadStrategy,
which was recreated during onActivityCreated.

Editing was busted since the previous patch did not call editHandlersetPage often enough.

The HtmlPageLoadStrategy still needs to use EditHandler.

Presently, we load the cached version of a page regardless of how the page
was reached. This is a bit too aggressive, since some pages are expected
by users to be updated relatively frequently, and users don't want to use
(or aren't aware of) our pull-to-refresh feature.

This patch makes it so that pages are loaded from cache only when
navigating back through the current backstack of pages, or when coming
back from savedInstanceState. For 'forward' navigation of pages, e.g.
clicking links, clicking history items, etc. will no longer use cache for
now.

This will be followed by a more comprehensive patch where we request the
current revision of the page from the network, and load the full page from
the network only if the revision is newer than what's cached.

When a config change occurred it saved a null value for the 'language' in onSaveInstanceState.
Subsequently, when the activity was recreated, it used the null value and compared it with
app.getAppOrSystemLanguageCode(), which is always set to a non-null string (in my case 'en').

Why is this affecting the page we're on? Because we use the language value to determine if
the language has changed and if we need to reset the site, which also goes to the sites main page.

Thus, it looks like we have to go back to Start, and don't collect our $400.
