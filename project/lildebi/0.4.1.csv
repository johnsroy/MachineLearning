this makes things more reusable, and also works around an odd bug where
/system/bin/sdcard would claim the imagefile, and not let go even when
umount was issued. For some reason, running umount in a separate script
fixes that issue, and then /system/bin/sdcard lets go of the imagefile.

This should be safe since busybox's mke2fs will fall back to using ext2 if
ext3 or ext4 is not supported properly, even though find_best_filesystem
reports otherwise.

It seems that a filesystem that has been formatted as ext2 will mount fine
as ext4, so always use the best available filesystem.
