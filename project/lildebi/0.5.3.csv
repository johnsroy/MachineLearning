unless specified otherwise, koush superuser when built from source uses
'com.thirdparty.superuser' so it doesn't conflict with the Play store
version. for example, the latest stable android-x86 build (4.4-r1) uses
this package name for the built-in version, and LilDebi doesn't see it,
prompting the user to install superuser.

This sets the language on the Debian install based on how the language is
set in Debian.  It will only generate the locales on install, but it will
always set the current locale in start-debian.sh.  If the current locale is
differen than the locale at install time, the user needs to manually gen
the current locale in Debian.
