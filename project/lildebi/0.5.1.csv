When lildebi is installed first time on a device, then /data/debian folder is
not present. So when the install screen (of installing in internal storage)
tries to calculate the free size of internal storage from /data/debian then an
exception is generated as /data/debian is not present.  So instead of
calculating free size from /data/debian, we will now calculate it from /data

The SD Card aka 'external storage' on Android can do weird stuff with the
path to support the multi-user stuff.  Using the canonical path seems to
help with some of the issues, and if that fails, then try the absolute path.

Android's `id` is in the PATH when this little snipped of code is run in

Lil' Debi currently only works with Superuser, and not SuperSU.  And it
requires an app to provide root access.  This moves the test to the first
screen, since it no longer attempts to get root access, but instead just
looks up the SU apps by packageName.

transparently, but SuperSU requires that you call su differently in order
to support that mount weirdness.  It is doable to support SuperSU, but I'll
leave it at 'patches welcome' since it is a proprietary app.
