Now that Lil' Debi defaults to using /etc/init.d/rc 0 to shutdown, these
rc.d scripts need to be removed from any existing Debian chroot as well.

Some standard enviroment variables are set by Android, then passed through to
the Debian environment unchanged.  That then causes a broken Debian
environment.  So these need to be set before starting the login shell.

The existing kill logic looks for all processed that have a root of
/data/debian (aka $mnt).  /debian/shell is started outside of the chroot so
it have a root of /, and it wasn't getting killed.

be killed if memory runs low.  Foreground Services must show a Notification
while running, so this includes a basic notification.

There is no reason to have multiple InstallActivity instances running, it
can take a fair amount of CPU/memory to load the install.log text file into
a TextView.  Often, singleTask behaves weirdly, but I think it should
make sense here because this is a one time, long running process.

This commit should drastically improve the performance of the install
process.  The old process was really horribly inefficient, it reposted the
entire contents of the log in order to update a single line.  This commit
also makes it so you can follow the log file in realtime using `tail -f` or
whatever.
