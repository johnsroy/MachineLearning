Using `faketime` means the timestamps are forced to being the same, and
that is enough to make the builds bit-for-bit repeatable on my machine.
Hopefully it is enough for repeatable builds on other machine as well.

Running a program with faketime causes that program to recent a fixed time
based on the timestamp provided to faketime.  This ensures that the
timestamps in the files are always the same.

This gets the process to the point where the APK signature is transferrable
no matter who builds it.  This process does not produce an APK with the
same hash.

Some setups will extract the debootstrap.deb with different permissions,

faketime needs to have a very specific timestamp format in order to freeze
time.  The time needs to be frozen so that the timestamps don't depend on
the speed of the machine that the build process is running on.  See `man
faketime` for more info on the 'advanced timestamp format'.  Also, force
time to UTC so its always the same on all machines.

busybox includes a timestamp in its code, set in a C macro called both
BB_BT and AUTOCONF_TIMESTAMP.  BB_BT is set to AUTOCONF_TIMESTAMP in the
build flags.  AUTOCONF_TIMESTAMP is set in busybox/include/autoconf.h. This
timestamp includes the time zone, so make sure it is always UTC.

I was using the write timestamp format, but I had forgotten the -f flag.
Adding it make faketime actually freeze time :-D

Thanks to Michael Rogers for spotting that.
