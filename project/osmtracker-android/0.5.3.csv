Tried to address issue with timezone between the 'track date' (uses default Locale) and the GPS timestamps (UTC) by using the first GPS timestamp as 'start time'. Not ideal though...

Ensured we start tracking with the correct track id, instead of relying on the fact that the service will be destroyed/recreated each time (currentTrackId was read only in onCreate() )
Ensured that if the TrackLogger activity is brought on top again, we're using the correct trackId.
