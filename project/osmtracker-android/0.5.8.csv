Aside: Added tests project to start writing unit tests.

Added GPX export test that compares output with an expected file. I also tried
to validate the XML file against the GPX schema, but that looks to be a pain
on Android as there's no built-in validator implementation.

Applied workaround from http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=14340
I had to bump the SDK version to 7 (Android 2.1) unfortunately.

Hard to test unfortunately, but it can't hurt.

Use Service.startForeground() as it's intended for services that are not
supposed to be killed like media players, or GPS trackers. Seems to fix
the issue in my manual tests with the emulator.
