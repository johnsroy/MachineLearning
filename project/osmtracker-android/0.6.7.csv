- Minor label changes
- Minor code style changes (consistency)
- Restore 'various_accuracy' string used in GPX export
- Ensure encapsulation of class fields
- Initialise waiting message for GpsStatusRecord otherwise it will display the placeholders until the GPS wakes up
- Keep logic of checking for a valid heading before returing the azimuth into SensorListener rather than having to implement it on the caller side

initial bug on the emulator, so fingers crossed...
