Was getting an NPE at TabHost.dispatchWindowFocusChanged(TabHost.java:295)
for Android 2.1. Android 2.2 and greater has been fixed with this commit:

http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/frameworks/base.git;a=blobdiff;f=core/java/android/widget/TabHost.java;h=412f817353a99054ab36234e1441b48c6c7ad820;hp=31920e764e6d25523b6dd5ffb1e4087d4d8fa3b0;hb=acdef59d66094f11da4a6f57194747dc06f73da2;hpb=159f0015418955501d8cf2744b0393db2e73f394

-which basically does a null-check in dispatchWindowFocusChanged()

Fix is to extend TabHost, and simply override the
dispatchWindowFocusChanged() method with a similar null-check.
