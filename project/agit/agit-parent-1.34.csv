This library is under active development and uses Maven, making it easier
for me as a potential contributor to get it building. It's also packaged
as an apklib making it easier to use without having to copy and paste code
into my own project.

Note that it was necessary to change the view's id from '@android:id/list'
to '@+id/pull_to_refresh_list_wrapper' to avoid this fatal error on screen
rotation:

The 128 KB space requirement comes from an quick look at the amount of

less on an Android device.

The searchbox works on honeycomb and above with SearchView, gingerbread

Caching helps though larger regexes could still take a long time to run for
a long filter list - doing 'indexOf' instead of regex appears to be around
ten times faster than regex.

Only decorate the displayed file matches

decorating *all* matching files can take a little time, putting this into
the viewholder code makes sense if we assume the user is going to spend
more time typing than scrolling up and down the screen.

Use monospace text for ref name in the file filter query box
