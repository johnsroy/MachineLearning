Although some of the Android docutmentino indicates otherwise, the Android
Market won't let you publish an APK with a lower versionCode than
previously published for that product. So unfortunately, we can't use
the nice 'versionCodeUpdateFromVersion' flag from android-maven-plugin v3.

Reverts some of commit 3b80319cb5a46c59035d0eaaefa728eb2c1513a7.
