Establishing the clone-url is always going to be the user's first priority,
so don't distract them with other fields until they've made headway on that
task.

This tweak is only enabled on Honeycomb and above, ie where the gentle
LayoutTransition animation is available. The change is too distracting if
it occurs instantly without animated fade-in.

The awful guice repository-scope problems are avoided by passing the repo down
as a parameter - so the TagViewer is no longer blank.

The robolectric test has been dying horribly on some systems, seemly due to
bytecode problems, and it didn't give any indication of failure when the
TagViewer regressed - so an integration test is replacing the robolectric one.

The 'No implementations match configuration.' errors that occur look like

...but the 'ActionBarSherlockRobolectric' approach in that thread led to
NPEs in this case :(

Note that a separate approach ( https://github.com/passy/absshadow-sample )
to combining ABS and Robolectric has already been implemented in Agit's
project with a5090874.
