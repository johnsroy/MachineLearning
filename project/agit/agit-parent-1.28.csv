RoboGuice 2 was complaining about not using Context-scoping, but I think
everything should be fine using the Application as the context.

This actually goes a bit further, and as well as allowing clone urls
like this to work:

https://rtyley:mypassword@github.com/rtyley/enigma.git

It also gets the string prompt stuff working so that it actually prompts
you for your username and password if they're not present in the url.

One thing it doesn't yet do is make the input box behave like a proper
password-entry box if it's a password tho...

This affects both username & password entry, but is the best option for
a blanket default behaviour

Distinguishing between username and password is a bit more work, and
there's not much harm making username entry password style as well -
especially as this is often put into the clone url.
