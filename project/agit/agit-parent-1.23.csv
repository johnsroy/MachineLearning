I've been holding off using the 3.0.0 line of maven-android-plugin because
the latest release doesn't yet contain this fix:

https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin/pull/42

...it's quite an annoying regression to live with (often killing a deploy
unexpectedly) but I guess I can live with it for a while. Just hope a new
release comes out before I'm driven to return to the 2.9.x series... :)

Should have done this a lot sooner. Thanks to Shawn Pearce on the JGit
mailing list for reminding me that this configuration existed (and was
configured way to high for Android!)

Using 1MB for packed Git limit & delta base cache allowed me to checkout
the official repo for Git (really slowly, about 20 minutes on my HTC
Desire)
