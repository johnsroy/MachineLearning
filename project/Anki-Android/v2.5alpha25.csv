Bug copied from de doc file: Dialog which does importing of apkg doesnâ€™t work properly (probably due to changing the target SDK?). Instead of confirmation dialog appearing when you select an apkg, you get kicked back to the previous dialog.

I don't know exactly why, but calling executePendingTransactions() just after the transaction.commit() seems to have solved the issue.
