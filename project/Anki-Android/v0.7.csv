use it to start the activity with the given deck opened. Currently this

assumes that there is only one deck for each file. However, the async
task that handles fetching the details of a deck for the widget
introduces a second deck open on the same database. Closing the database
that is used by someone else causes an issue.

The previous solution was to close the database and re-open it after
scanning all the decks, however, this is no longer sufficient because
the scan now happens in a background thread and therefore possibly
concurrently with other operations on the database.

Instead, close the database only if it is not the current deck in the
application. This is not (yet) 100% bullet proof because it is still
possible for someone to open the database between the time it is
compared with the current deck and the time it is actually closed.

The Xoom uses a different theme, where the buttons are semi-transparent
and the text color is white. This works well on the activities with a
dark background (like the study options activity) but not in others

This commit introduces a style to be applied to the buttons that is
empty by default but that defines the text color to be black for the SDK
version 11 (Honeycomb). This is achived by creating a values-v11
directory and redefining the style in a file named styles.xml in that
directory.

For the deck picker activity instead, remove the gray bar under the
button at the screen: it does not seem necessary and it does not match
the content of the list above it. This prevents the problem with the
background and the text color being too close (light gray and white).

may slow down other operations on the database.

Keep track in a preference whether the widget is enabled and only
refresh the list of decks if the widget is actually in use.

This commit adds two new classes: AnkiDroid and AnkiDesktop.

The AnkiDroid is always visible in AnkiDroid and AnkiDesktop is always
invisible. This allows building a card layout which is different between
the AnkiDroid and Anki on the desktop.

Simply add:

<style>.AnkiDroid { display: none }</style>

to the card template of your deck.

Then, wrap anything that should be displayed only on the desktop with:

<div class='AnkiDesktop'>
...
</div>

Last, wrap anything that should be displayed only on AnkiDroid with:

<div class='AnkiDroid'>
...
</div>

The former will only be displayed when reviewing on the desktop client.
The former will only be displayed when reviewing on AnkiDroid.

https://github.com/nicolas-raoul/Anki-Android/commit/7684fa359c5f51d96156c97c186c4d110d562e75

accidentally removed the font name from the generated CSS.
As a consequence custom fonts (or any fonts) are no longer working since
0.7beta6.

This commit reinstates the font-family in the CSS and therefore fixes
the custom fonts.

The main reason for this is that there is a leak in WebView related to
loading fonts. When a font is loaded a large amount of native memory is
allocated, and re-allocated each time a webpage is loaded. This quickly
leads to the process being killed because it uses too much memory.

The solution applied here is to release the WebView each time a new page
is loaded, which releases the memory used to load the font in the first
WebView.

This addresses the following:
