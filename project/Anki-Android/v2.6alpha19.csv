* Simplify the logic for dynamic permission checking
* Add a fallback method to get calling package name on all APIs
* Set 'exported' property to False in all Activities other than IntentHandler, as these are possible attack points. Currently only NoteEditor was actually exported due to inclusion of an IntentFilter.

Note: While it would be possible to allow the provider to work even from its own process, this is not considered good practice, so we keep it disabled on production builds until such time as it becomes explicitly required.
One reason that it is not recommended to allow this is to prevent accidental calling of checkCallingOrSelfPermission() after a call to Binder.clearCallingIdentity()
