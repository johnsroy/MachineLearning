Behaviour is now the following:
* Text from text fields is always passed in (not only when editing notes).
* For text fields, the previous text is completely replaced.
* For fields with focus, media are inserted at the cursor position.
* For fields without focus, media are inserted at the end.
* Removed the ' - ' that was inserted when changing to a text field.
