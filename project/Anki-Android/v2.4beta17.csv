Throw RuntimeException when Card.load() and Note.load() fail (anki Desktop code automatically throws an exception)
Change the error dialog which is shown when libanki exceptions are caught to give a more specific message depending on whether or not the onDatabaseCorrupt() hander was called
If collection doesn't exist then allow user to change path
