Implements the answering of a card and spaces it as desktop Anki does.
Not tested yet and the code is not used from the GUI yet. This does not
include support for leeches as I don't know what is going on with the
SQLAlchemy magic.

Moved all deck-related code from Ankidroid to a the new class

uses a callback mechanism to allow ui operations in Ankidroid.

Data types for time entries in the database changed from single to
double precision floating point numbers. Single precision was not
enough.

'Washington' alone can be several other locations in the USA, and would more commonly refer to the state of Washington rather than the capital city.

Also, capitals for China, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Nigeria were added - their inclusion warranted by virtue of being among the 10 most populace countries (ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population).

Finally, capitals for South Korea, Mexico, United Kingdom were added due the stature and size of the cities themselves (ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_capitals_by_population), and because I'm on a roll.

I understand that this deck was likely intended solely to demo Anki-android, but it may as well be accurate and thorough :)
