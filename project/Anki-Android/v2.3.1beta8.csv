chunk() was failing to gather anything but the first batch
of changes as the logic to determine whether there were
more changes was wrong.

with the recent change to a 250 chunk size, any users
who changed more than 250 cards on AD and synced may have
collections that don't match what's on AnkiWeb, so
for the 2.3.1 release I recommend you advise  users to force
a full sync to correct any possible problems
