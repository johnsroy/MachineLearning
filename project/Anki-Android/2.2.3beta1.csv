Unicode normalization is not supported on Android 2.2 and below. Since the new media sync protocol requires file names to be normalized in NFC form, we now abandon a media sync if we detect a media file name that cannot be entirely represented in the ASCII encoding and disable media syncing on that device.

This approach is likely to allow a number of users on those devices to still be able to sync media without issue.

Note: A dialog is shown if media becomes disabled after a sync. Collection syncing is unaffected.

Temporary measure until we can find a reliable way to detect the file system type.
