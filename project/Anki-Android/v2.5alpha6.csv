Added new icons, both holo light and holo dark, taken from https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/
Added script to generate pngs from svgs.  Makes icons for all sizes and themes given. Includes modified svgs to use as source.
Added some night-mode logic[1] to use icons.

Remove ic_menu_manage

Script generates holo-light icons using:
Color: #333333
Enabled: 60% opacity
Disabled: 30% opacity

The following icons (and _dark versions) added to  mdpi, hdpi, xhdpi, xxhdip.

ic_menu_refresh (from ic_sync_24px.svg)
ic_action_whiteboard_enable_light (from ic_brush_24px.svg)
ic_menu_revert (from ic_undo_24px.svg)

[1] This is painful, as this code should be made simpler, not more complex, by using themes and attributes.
But the only way to avoid this do a complete rewrite.
