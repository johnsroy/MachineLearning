The previous use of the javascript interface was to handle taps made on the image playback button to play sounds with the device's media player. With this commit, we now do it by handling links added to the playback buttons marked with a prefix specifically for audio playback. In the future, new protocols (or prefixes) can be added to handle any new commands that must be handled in Java code. The rest of the interface contained some old code for image resizing but is no longer used and can be safely removed.

Commit 'fd0e0b2'
Automatically remove trailing whitespace with emacs.

Commit '6322b66'
Compare the typed text pretty much as is to the correct text with HTML removed and “&lt;”s &c. unescaped. (And escaped for display.)
Escape “\”s by hand there, as the Android WebView seems to swallow those.
