Redesigned deck picker that gets rid of the filesystem browser. The path
to the folder in which the decks are stored are set in the preferences.
The picker screen then shows a list of all the decks.

Deck.java contains a new class to represent the top level object in the
database, the deck. It is nowhere near finished, but is supposed to
contain the functionality of the Deck class in libanki.

No new data is written to the database. Read data (due cards etc.) is
cached and might be out of date.

There can be quite a delay when getting the next card from a big deck.
So I added a simple progress dialog when loading a new deck, so that the
user knows something has happened when he selects a new deck. This
implied creating a new thread to do the loading while the ui thread
shows the dialog.

Non-cached version of the counts for new and due cards for each deck
listed in the deck picker. Ported quite a bit of python code from
libanki to make it happen (ie. there are probably bugs).

tagIds() in Deck.java is only declared, but
not implemented since it will not be called from the current code. However
it needs implementation for possible future calls to it.

Delegates the loading of the card counts to a separate thread to improve

this, a deck choise will not be acted upon until the counts for all the

loader thread will stop loading new decks if one has already been

Also fixed an issue about the deck not being loaded again when pressing

card. It's just a quick fix in Ankidroid.onResume(), not very pretty.
