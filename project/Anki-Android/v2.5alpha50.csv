- Provide an appropriate warning when attempting to delete the default
deck instead of doing nothing.
- Don't show a warning when deleting an empty deck. The user might think
we are showing a warning because they are about to lose data, which is
not the case.
- Show the number of cards about to be deleted since we are already
calculating it. It's useful, and the desktop client shows it as well.
