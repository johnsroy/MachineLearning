Reviewing would get one new card more than specified in newCardsPerDay.
This was because decreasing the count of reviewed new cards happend after
getting the next new card.

Card edit activity generates fields based on the underlying Fact instead of the card.
- Each field in the fact generates a seperate EditText
- When saving updated cards
- Facts are saved,
- Then all cards based on the fact are regenerated based on their CardModel
- Some messy code (mostly related to updating and redisplaying the current card)

Surround all cursor statements with try...finally to make sure that the
cursor is closed at all times, even when an unexpected exception occurs.
If a cursor is not closed, java will throw an exception, but it is
silently (well, it can be seen in the log) discarded and does not cause
a force close. However, it does cause a noticeable slow-down in the execution.
