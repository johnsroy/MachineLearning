The previous approach relied on a complex search for HTML elements
containing text and the CSS rules to style them. It is much simpler and
more efficient to zoom the entire card (including images) with a single
CSS rule.

The existing card and image scaling preferences were renamed to better
reflect their purpose and moved to a more sensible section of the
preferences screen. This commit will also update the old preferences
on the next version upgrade.

Decrementing the rep count in the scheduler in order to report accurate
rep counts to the user was having an effect on deciding when the next
rep/rev card should be distributed (i.e., the rotation started one card
too late)
