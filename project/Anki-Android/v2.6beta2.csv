- Make the order of the legend's elements in the statistics charts deterministic (solves https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3349)
- Change text of legend item 'Suspended' in the 'Cards Types' pie chart start to 'Suspended+Buried' (solves https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3349 and https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3562)

- Explain the algorithm used for calculating ticks in ChartBuilder
- Explain why we use LinkedHashMap instead of HashMap (to retain order of Legend Items)
- Adhere to code conventions

- Behave consistently with Anki Desktop in case of no reviews. In that case the pie chart should not be shown at all (it was all yellow). This was reported between the lines of this issue:https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android/issues/3384

- Replace if / else by (mSum == 0) ? 1 : mSum
