Since card content scrolls vertically it makes sense to still use 90%
for max-height in order to keep some of the card visible (like text
above or below an image).

The pre-Chrome engine (Android 4.3 and below) uses the screen's
dimensions to determine the width, so we need to keep that at the
original 90% to avoid horizontal overflow. The Chrome engine uses the
dimensions of the parent element so we safely use 100% without causing
overflow.
