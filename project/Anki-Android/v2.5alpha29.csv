When syncing my collection, I'm getting this error:

W/System.err(17831): java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer cannot be cast to java.lang.Long
W/System.err(17831): 	at com.ichi2.libanki.sync.Syncer.mergeNotes(Syncer.java:881)
W/System.err(17831): 	at com.ichi2.libanki.sync.Syncer.applyChunk(Syncer.java:566)
W/System.err(17831): 	at com.ichi2.libanki.sync.Syncer.sync(Syncer.java:182)
[...]

So sometimes the note ID is an Integer rather than a Long.

Using Long.valueOf(((Number) foo).longValue()) will work for both Longs
and Integers.

The splash screen wasn't working very well, and was actually unecessarily making the interface feel slower everytime the collection needed to be opened anyway.
This removes the splash screen entirely, and instead adds a progress indicator to the action bar when the collection is loading, and shows a toast when the external storage is not mounted before closing the app.
