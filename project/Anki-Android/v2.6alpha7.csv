1. Explicitly enforce automatically showing question/answers only for values > 0 (previously gestures and edits caused a 'fall through' by circumventing mLastClickTime).
2. Start card timer after undo (previously the start time was left at the default NaN which caused pause-resume after an undo to always reset the UI timer).
3. Restart card timer after edits that changed the card (previously only the UI timer was restarted, which however was then reset back to the old card timer's value after a pause-resume).
