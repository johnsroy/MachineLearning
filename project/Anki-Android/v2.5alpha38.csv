* Removed old resources related to the TagsDialog;
* Added Dialog for adding a tag. However, if the SearchActionItem is expanded and is not empty, the user can add the typed tag by clicking the AddTagActionItem;
* The EditTexts in the Dialog for adding a tag and in the SearchView have a filter that doesn't allow the user to type spaces or commas;
* There is no more 'knowsHowToAddTag' shared preference;
* Shows a Snackbar for new tags and when the tag already exists. For each case, a different message is shown;
* If the user tries to add a tag that already exists, it is simply checked for him;
* Empty tags are not added and no message is shown;
* The Toolbar uses the same style as the app-wide toolbar;
* The select all action selects or deselects only the tags being displayed;
* The SearchQuery hint is `Add/filter tags` when the dialog type is `TYPE_ADD_TAG`, otherwise it is `Filter tags`;
* The add menu action only is shown if the dialog is of the type `TYPE_ADD_TAG`.
