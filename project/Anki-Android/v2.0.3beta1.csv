We were suppressing the warning here because we were calling a function
available only in API 16. However, that causes crashes on some versions
of Android and using the Compat interface turned out to be a better
solution.

Now, we can remove the suppressed warning since there is no longer a
warning.

This might have been needed in the older table layout but now serves no purpose. Removing this fixes a layout issue in Android 2.3, where the inlined image appears behind card content, making it untappable.
