Restores the previous logic for adding the right items to the menu and
fix the underlying problem.

The problem was that we do not call 'invalidateOptionsMenu()' when the
current card changes. This means that while it is initially loading, we
set the options menu to be hidden, and we never actually change it
contents.

Instead of splitting the logic into two different paths (pre- and post-

This was introduced by:
https://github.com/flerda/Anki-Android/commit/681eda513f87074694e8df81e6dc49b21f90c41e
in order to force showing the notification area.

However, this causes flickering which is only partially fixed by the
existing implementation. Since it is still possible to switch to the
home screen to check the notifications, I think it is okay to remove it.

If we wanted a quick way to see the notification, I would suggest having
some way to toggle fullscreen from the options menu instead.
