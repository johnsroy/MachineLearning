"7d110c5367cabbb93538a95395da099b8eab2689","2016-03-02 12:35:52+08:00","Added content provider support for bulkInsert() or multiple notes into a single deck. This is done by including a new deckId query parameter in the uri.
For example: content://com.ichi2.anki.flashcards/notes?deckId=1234567890123
AddContentApi supports this with a new addNotes() method. The Api does the duplicate checking to make sure no duplicates are passed to bulkInsert().
These implementations check whether the provider supports these new features using a spec version code defined as a meta-data key of the provider in the manifest.
The new bulkInsert support for notes is 2000% faster (based on inserting 2100+ notes) than inserting notes one-by-one (as in the old way).
