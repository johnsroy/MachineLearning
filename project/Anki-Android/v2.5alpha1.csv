"8f8bf9aed84ffd50618f03457b2be8bbbfe36885","2015-03-16 21:58:29+11:00","Re-work deck list building and interface refreshes

The primary data structure used to build the decklist ('deck due tree') has been rewritten to more closely follow the desktop version. Any post-processing done on the list (e.g., indenting subdecks) are now done entirely in the UI code (DeckPIcker) instead of the scheduler.

Interface refreshing has been refactored and now has fewer entry points and is easier to understand and manage. Many redundant interface updates have been removed and fixed some cases where it wasn't done correctly. In the dual panel interface, many inconsistencies between the deck list and study options fragment have been resolved.

The widget values and global remaining card count are inaccurate following this commit and will need to be fixed in the future.
