Now, all images are resized using Javascript to fit the available space on screen. It works both for local and remote images, for both portrait and landscape and even, if the device is rotated reviewing a card, the card is refreshed so its images will be rescaled to make better use of the available space. I also deleted the Image class because it was not necessary anymore.
