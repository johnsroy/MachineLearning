Use unit symbols (s, min, d, mo, yr) in the ease (answer) buttons like Anki desktop.
Use the correct decimal separator, “.” for most languages, “,” for French, German and maybe other.
Some other, related clean up.
Added some requested fixes

The gradient appears on the left side of the xlarge layout for tablets
to make it clear that the deck list and the fragment are separate
elements.

Removed unused methods, dead code, and redundant TaskData parameters.
Made sure every task runs with a current reference to the main
Collection object. This fixes various issues with DeckTasks failing
when queued up after a task that closes the collection as part of its
routine (e.g., sync).
