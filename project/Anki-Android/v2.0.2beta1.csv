Currently the buttons do not have an explicit text color. This works if

fails if the default color is not readable.

This commit makes the color explicit and therefore makes it the same on
all devices.

WebView switching was added in Android 0.7 to fix a bug with custom
fonts on some versions of Android. However, recent versions of Android
seem to have fixed this issue.

This commit adds a setting to force quick updating of WebViews, so that
we can ask users to test this on a number of devices with the next
release and see if this is still an issue on any device.

Hopefully, we can identify which versions of Android we can disable the
workaround by default and possibly remove the setting in future
versions.

Currently, the listener is not told which task it is being notified

This commit updates the Travis Continuous Integration configuration to

I chose a different approach to installing the SDK, that avoid depending
on the order in which things are returned by the tool and breaks each
time something changes (like a new release). Instead use static links to
the SDK components that we need.

Since the continuous build is not reliable enough (or at least I am not
sure it is), also only notify myself of failures.

Workaround for Issue 1746.
A Samsung bug leaves devices unable to use the clipboard. AnkiDroid
will crash while using the clipboard on those devices (i.e., every time
the reviewer opens). Here, we disable the text selection setting so
the clipboard isn't used and AnkiDroid can continue to review cards.
