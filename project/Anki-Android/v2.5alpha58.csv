We were using !important in the actual CSS font definitions which is wrong. E.g. @font-face {font-family: 'kochi-mincho-subst' !important; font-weight: normal !important; font-style: normal !important; src: url('file:///sdcard/AnkiDroid/fonts/kochi-mincho-subst.ttf');}.
!important should only go in the class:
BODY, .card, * { font-family: 'kochi-mincho-subst' !important; font-weight: normal !important; font-style: normal !important; }
