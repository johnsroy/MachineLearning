This should fix issue #1336
Make the whiteboard square and big enough for both orientations.
Like this we don’t need the special resize and mRecreateBitmap
functions any more.

(I guess we could reduce the height of the white board by the
height of the buttons and the title bar bit at some other time.)

In the 2.0 refactoring of the code, the notification pending intent was
pointing to a fragment instead of an activity, which will not work
correctly.

Fix this by pointing to the DeckPicker, which is now the main entry
point for the application.

This is currently commented out, but this actually was an issue with the
1.1.3 release, so it is better to fix this now.

The manifest element <uses-permission> does not actually defines an
attribute android:required, and instead that should be used with
<uses-feature>.

With the current setup, if the block is uncommented, this means that the
application would not be available in the Google Play Store to devices
that do not have bluetooth.

The deck description is defined to be HTML, but it is currently treated
as plain text by AnkiDroid when displaying it below the deck name.

Parse it as HTML and convert it to a spannable string with formatting.
This fixes the displaying of the string but not the editing, which still
shows the HTML and requires you to edit the HTML. Using a rich-text
editor would be better there, but beyond the scope of 2.0, so leave it
as is for now.
