The application on Honeycomb needs to derive from the Holo and
Holo.Light themes in order to have the action bar, which is the only way
to access a number of the functionalities, including the menu.

This commit adds a copy of themes.xml in the values-v11 directory, where
the themes used by the application derive from the Honeycomb base
themes.

The underlying reason for the issue is that in Honeycomb the menu items
are generated whenever the action bar is shown instead of when the user
presses the menu key on the device; as a consequence, the StudyOptions
activity will get first a disabled Sync button in the action bar (while
the deck is loading) and this will not be enabled when the deck finally
loads (or disabled when the deck is closed).

To fix this, we need to call Activity.invalidateOptionsMenu() any time
something happens that causes the options menu options to change.

However, this method is only available is API Level 11 and above. To fix
this (and future problems of this sort). I introduced a new Compat
interface which is meant to contain functions which need to be
implemented differently on different API levels.

There are a number of implementations of this interface (currently on
CompatV3 and CompatV11) which may do different things on the different
platforms: for example, there is no need to invalidate the options menu
items on any platform before Honeycomb, so
Compat.invalidOptionsMenu(Activity) is simply an empty function in
CompatV3.

The StyleDialog builder was incorrectly notifying the latest listener
instead of the one set at construction time, which means that if the
builder is re-used, it will actually update the listener to be used when
the dialog button is clicked.

In the case above, the 'Ok' button on the missing media dialog was
actually calling the listener to the 'Ok' button of the restore dialog,
causing issues because no deck was open at the time the listener is
invoked.

I removed all references to members of the builder by creating a static
nested class instead of using an anonymous inner class. This should fix
this and possibly other issues.

Scenario:
- open a deck on AnkiDroid without starting the review
- open it on AnkiDesktop, do any change and sync; undoEnabled is then
set as false.
- sync it on AnkiDroid; undoEnabled will be set to false.
- start now review, review the first card and try undoing: the button
will be disabled!

This simple change disables its syncing and fixes this bug. Moreover, there is
no need to sync mUndoEnabled - it is not even persisted to the database!
Finally, I do not get when undoEnabled is ever set to true in AnkiDesktop.
