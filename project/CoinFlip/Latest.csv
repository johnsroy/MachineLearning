Pausing the app would disable the shake listener, but the animation thread wasn't finished running, then the callback would re-enable the shake listener even though the app dropped to the background.  Solved this by a stricter management of the onClick/shake listeners during pause/resume and removing shake listener callbacks onPause.

Also made a separate settings.xml file for v14+ devices which uses the fancy SwitchPreference instead of CheckBoxPreference.

Bumped version to v5.5 for the Play Store.
