The old rules prevent using xkcd passwords and other good password techniques.
The requirement for upper, lower, and number makes less sense on mobile,
IMHO, since those combos are so much harder to type.
With things like swype, using long all-lowercase
passwords makes much more sense.

On the Nexus 7 virtual device, the menu choices to make the font smaller
instead made the font larger. While debugging and stepping through the code I
saw that the text size returned on line 109 of NoteEdit.java increased over
successive selections of the 'Smaller' menu option - the opposite of what it
should have done, but that explained the visual change that I was seeing on
screen.

I found that this behavior was fixed with a change to the setTextSize() call
on line 111 to explicitly set the unit of change.
