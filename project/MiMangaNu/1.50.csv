+ make SearchResultsFragment's PerformSearchTask cancelable
previously when a user would search for something vague
like for example the letter 'l' on Kissmanga the search would take long
due to the vagueness of the search term and then the user might decide to go back
and refine the search term or try on a different server but since the search was still
ongoing in the background the user would be blocked from searching again / opening
a connection to a new server until the old search would finish in the background which
could take a long time. This is now fixed.
We immediately cancel the PerformSearchTask when the SearchResultsFragment
is detached which makes the app feel more snappy in the mentioned use case.
