Do not set locale to 'C' for LC_NUMERIC, and do not call setlocale at all on
Android, because:
- Since Lollipop, Android attempts to do something in setlocale, but its
implementation is far from complete and makes no sense for us at this point.
- Older Android versions used to completely ignore setlocale() calls.
