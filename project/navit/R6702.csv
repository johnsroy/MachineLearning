This reverts commit 53b333a617146bc304063f8ddd0dfe2927bb6064.

That commit made POI filtering behave unexpectedly, returning empty result
sets sometimes. I was able to reproduce it on x64 linux in following way:
start POI filtering, then press 'POIs' on the top to return to POI list,
then press looking glass to start POI filter once again.

I was unable to get non-empty results on my Android device.

It also has introduced some valgrind warnings about accessing an already freed
location after query text is entered and actual search is fired.

Hope @mvglasow will take a closer look on this issue.
