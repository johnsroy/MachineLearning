Tinting the navigation and status bars (introduced in a3e9e7) makes
the whole screen tinted on my Gingerbread (API level 9) device.
As the actual tint code in handleResize is anyway activated on API>=17,
there's no reason to create navigationTintView and statusTintView on API<17.

There's no way to make navigation and status bar translucent nor
transparent before KITKAT, see https://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-4.4.html#UI
So corresponding code realted to SystemBarTintView should be enabled since
API 19, KITKAT.
It actually was breaking navit on my API 17 device, drawing unrelated
semitransparent bars on the top and right sides of the screen.
