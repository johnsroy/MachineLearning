During table rendering, do not disable off-screen table entries by
toggling STATE_SENSITIVE. Doing so breaks the menu items 'Set distance to'/
'Get more'; these must never be STATE_SENSITIVE, since their sub-widgets
should receive clicks.
Instead, use STATE_OFFSCREEN to mark off-screen entries and skip them
during traversal with a rotary encoder.
