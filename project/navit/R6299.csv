Add Doxygen comments for font/freetype and graphics.c, and move comment
from static function to freetype.h, where Doxygen will read it.

Remove unused members from struct font_freetype_text.

The 'depth' parameter was only required for the gtk_drawing_area graphics
plugin, before it was switched to use Cairo. Now all graphics drivers
use depth=32, so that case is now hardcoded.
