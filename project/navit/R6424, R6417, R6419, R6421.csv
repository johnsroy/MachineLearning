The Prev/Next buttons in the search result list of the internal GUI
can be selected by moving the input focus using the arrow keys. This fix
prevents the Prev/Next buttons from staying hightlighted when the focus
is moved away.

Fixes for the on-screen keyboard of the search dialog in the internal
GUI:
Switch the keyboard to lower-case after first input character, even if
entered via the physical keyboard.
Switch back to upper-case and un-highlight all keys if user clears search input.

Prevent the Prev/Next buttons in the search dialog from being reachable
using the cursor keys even if they are not displayed.

To reproduce: Open search dialog, press Cursor down until focus returns
to the top of the screen. Without this fix, the Prev button appears at
the top of the screen and is focused.

Allow navigating the menus of the internal GUI with only PgUp/PgDown
keys, instead of using arrow and Enter keys (which remains supported).
This allows to operate the menus with a rotary encoder, if its two
actions are mapped to PgUp/PgDown.

In the search menu, if the Prev/Next buttons are visible and the
keyboard is hidden, going backwards with PgUp skips some widgets.
