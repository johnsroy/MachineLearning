- Due to AOSP bug in API level 21, we cant check the number of failed unlock attempts. Hence we hide the checkbox for this option on devices running API level 21. We also verify the functionality before enabling protection.

Added option to check for number of failed unlock attempts manually and wipe when neccessary. This bypasses the lock screen warning message making the protection more stealthy. Does not work on Android 5.0/5.0.1
