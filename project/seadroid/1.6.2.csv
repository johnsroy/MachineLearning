Reasoning: Temp files aren't deleted after upload.
If the user tries to upload the same file twice,
the temp file cannot be created again, causing an

throw new RuntimeException('could not create temporary file');

We can't delete or overwrite the existing temp file, as the upload
might still be in progress.

There are other ways to fix this issue, but this is the simplest solution,
as far as I can see.

This is a workaround. Many users of GET_DOCUMENT/OPEN_DOCUMENT
don't realize that opening a file might cause network access and thus do
them in the ui thread. This results in a NetworkOnMainThreadException.

Therefore do the download in another thread and block until the download
is complete. This is also the behaviour of Google Drive's DocumentProvider
implementation.

This fixes NetworkOnMainThreadExceptions in

sometimes the SAF file chooser can choke up when displaying high resolution

Fix this by returning the file descriptor early, and then agressively close
the pipe if we get a cancellation signal.
