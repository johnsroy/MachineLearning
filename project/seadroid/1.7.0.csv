Set a ViewPager.PageTransformer that will be called for each attached page whenever the scroll position is changed. This allows the application to apply custom property transformations to each page, overriding the default sliding look and feel.

Note: Prior to Android 3.0 the property animation APIs did not exist. As a result, setting a PageTransformer prior to Android 3.0 (API 11) will have no effect.
