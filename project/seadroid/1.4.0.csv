Previously the application context was used. However this class is also used
by the StorageProvider, which might be created before the application.
Therefore the first user has to provide the context for the singleton
instance.

This is a workaround. Some part in the Seafile file download code seems
to be not thread safe. To avoid problems, serialize the whole getFile() function.

The issue observed was that two mkdirs() on the same directory collided.

This adds support for the Storage Access Framework, that had been introduced
with API level 19. On older devices the feature will automatically be disabled.

Supported features:
* browsing directories multiple accounts
* downloading files
* displaying thumbnails of cached files

Missing features:
* remeber recently used documents
* Uploading/Creating/Deleting files
* full thumbnail support (would likely require server side assistance)
