Reasoning: Temp files aren't deleted after upload.
If the user tries to upload the same file twice,
the temp file cannot be created again, causing an

throw new RuntimeException('could not create temporary file');

We can't delete or overwrite the existing temp file, as the upload
might still be in progress.

There are other ways to fix this issue, but this is the simplest solution,
as far as I can see.

This is a workaround. Many users of GET_DOCUMENT/OPEN_DOCUMENT
don't realize that opening a file might cause network access and thus do
them in the ui thread. This results in a NetworkOnMainThreadException.

Therefore do the download in another thread and block until the download
is complete. This is also the behaviour of Google Drive's DocumentProvider
implementation.

This fixes NetworkOnMainThreadExceptions in

sometimes the SAF file chooser can choke up when displaying high resolution
thumbnails (like on a tabled in grid view). The reason was that we tried
to write into a pipe with an unconected end. the pipe buffer would run fill
and then block.

Fix this by returning the file descriptor early, and then agressively close
the pipe if we get a cancellation signal.

Previously I treated them as the same. After re-reading the API of DocumentContract,
I've become convinced that this way it adheres more to what the API designers
had in mind.

(The old way did not cause any bugs, as far as I'm aware)

The purpose of notify() is to make SAF do a new queryChildDocuments().

But if the notify() is done too soon, then the first queryChildDocuments()
is still running. This results in the notify() being ignored.

This fixes the bug that sometimes the 'reload ring' would never go away.

If the server is unreachable, we don't allow download of any files.
To make this fact more clear to the user, grey out all entries in an
Seafile account.

The reachability test is done for every server individually.

This should mostly avoid issues of users trying to download files from unavailable
servers.

change the way we avoid infinite refresh loops.
previously the user had to change the directory to trigger
a refresh. this is problematic if there is only one directory
(the list of repos). the user will never be able to trigger a refresh.

this fixes the following issue: There is only one server, and that
server is greyed out due to unreachability. Then the user won't be
able to get SeafileProvider to retest if the server has become available
again.
