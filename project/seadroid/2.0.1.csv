API 23 introduces runtime permissions:

https://developer.android.com/about/versions/marshmallow/android-6.0-changes.html#behavior-runtime-permissions

Once an app targets API 23, the user isn't shown the list of required permissions
during install. Instead, the app has to check and ask the user for
permissions on first use (checkSelfPermissions() / requestPermissions()).

At the moment, Seadroid is not implementing this new permissions API. So
targeting Seadroid for API level 23 would break it on Android 6.0 devices
when newly installed.

It might make sense to ask for all of those permissions as soon as the app launches.

If the user is running Android 6.0 (API level 23) or later, the user has to grant your app its permissions while they are running the app.
