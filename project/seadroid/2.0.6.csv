Currently, absolute paths are saved for each repository in the REPODIR_TABLE.

This didn't matter in the past, aslong as Seadroid had a fixed cache directory.
However, the next patch in this patchset will allow users to move the directory
to other storage devices.

This patch increments the Database Version, since the meaning of
REPODIR_COLUMN_REPO_DIR is changed. While at it, also remove the column
REPODIR_COLUMN_REPO_NAME, as it is unneccessary (REPO_ID is a sufficient key).

Since KitKat there is an API to access SD cards and similar external memories.
This patch adds support for that.

User-visible changes:
* Add an option to the settings dialog to switch storage location (on KitKat+)
Only storage locations offered by the Android system are shown. Usually these
are microSD cards hidden behind some removable cover. USB-to-go devices are
usually not listed. When switching the storage location, existing cached files
are moved to the new location.
* When the selected external storage location becomes unavailable (the user
removes the SD card), there is an automatic and temporary fallback to the
classic storage location. Once the microSD card is put back, Seadroid will
automatically switch back to it.
* When starting Seadroid for the first time, the storage with the most free
space is selected. (on KitKat+).
* The 'Cache clear' button now clears the cache for all accounts. Previously
it just cleared the cache of the account currently shown in the
BrowserActivity. In my opinion this better matches user expectations.
* 'Cache size' now lists the cache size of all accounts combined.
* Relabling of 'Advanced settings' into 'Cache storage settings' in the
settings screen.

Internal changes:
* There was a bit of refactoring neccessary. Part of the DataManager has been
split out into a 'StorageManager'.
* The StorageManager is an abstract class with implementations for
Gingerbread, KitKat and Lollipop. Gingerbread don't offer access to external
storage. Kitkat offers access to external media. However, due to design flaw
in the Android framework, a workaround is neccessary to make media show up in
the gallery. Lollipop finally supports external storage without any issues.
* Small changes all over the place to use the StorageManager instead of
DataManager.
* Creating and naming of temp files has been cleaned up.

Currently, JSON files containing listings of repositories and files/directories
are stored in external memory, where many other apps have read/write access to.
This is a potential privacy issue. The user will likely understand that
downloaded/cached files will be accessible by other apps. However, the fact
that directory listings and the list of repositories on a server are silently
accessible by other apps as well, that is not obvious and should therefore not
be allowed.

This patch changes the storage path for Seadroid JSON files to the internal
cache directory. Only Seadroid (and root-apps) have access to that directory.

Camera Upload tries to avoid creating duplicates when uploading files.
Previously, only the exact file name was checked for existence on the server.
This failed in situations where the file was already existing under a
duplicate name, like 'DSC0001 (1).jpg'.

This patch addresses that by using a regex to compare the filenames.

This fixes issue #503

1. deleted options when using universal image loader, leads up to account images never shown
2. the CircleImageView widget couldn`t work well with UIL, left total black when first loading avatars
Note that,
I also have tried https://github.com/vinc3m1/RoundedImageView and https://github.com/hdodenhof/CircleImageView with no success.
Both failed to work with UIL, maybe I didn`t firgure out the correct usage, or wait and I will find a way out later :-)
