Previously it was assumed that SeafileProvider.queryRoots() would be called
before any of the other SeafileProvider.queryXXX() methods. That was a mistake.
At least SeafileProvider.queryDocument() might actually be called earlier.

This can cause problems if the Android OS has just been freshly rebooted and
the SAF is used for the first time. In that case

SeafileProvider.isReachable

will still be empty. Thus doing an

SeafileProvider.isReachable.get(account)

will return null. That breaks thinks, as can be witnessed e.g. by trying to use
latest Keepass2Android release with Seadroid after a fresh reboot.

This patches fixes that issue by converting the HashMap into a Set
(which is a more fitting data structure anyway).

(Making Account 'Comparable' is just necessary to make the ConcurrentSkipListSet
work.)

Seadroid /knows/ the mime type of the file. Why ask the user for it?
The issue is not an unknown mime type but that there is no suitable app.

So lets to this instead:

- give the user a warning that no app is available.
- show a list of all available apps. If the user knows more than Seadroid,
let her make the right choice.

Currently the BrowseActivity finishes itself after opening a file.
So if a user had to do a lot of business is a specific directory, she
would have to enter that directory again and again.

Better to start the ACTION_NEW in a new task and keep Seadroid around
in the background.

The previous commit had the slightly ugly bug that the File Activity
would not close after a download was finished. It would have to be
closed by the user manually through the 'back' button.

This patch adresses that. It makes the FileActivity close itself after
the download is complete.
