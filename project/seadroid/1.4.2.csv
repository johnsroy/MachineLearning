This patch forces Seadroid to use a specific list of TLS protocols.
Specifically, SSLv3 is disabled, as it is considered insecure by now.
Also TLSv1.1+ are enabled (they are available with API 16+ but disabled
up to API 19).

To do so, we have to inherit from SSLSocketFactory, which makes the codes
somewhat verbose. The upside is that this class can later be used to further
modify the Android defaults concerning SSL (e.g. cyphersuites used).

This patch also fixes a NPE when connecting to a server that only supports
TLSv1.2.

By default Android will offer the HTTPS server ciphers which are today
considered to be insecure (e.g. SSL_DHE_DSS_EXPORT_WITH_DES40_CBC_SHA).
A properly configured server should reject those ciphers, but better be
on the safe side on not offer those ciphers by the client at all.

Additionally the order of the cipher matters as well, as more secure/fast
ciphers should be at the top of the list.

This patch adds a cipher list based on
https://briansmith.org/browser-ciphersuites-01.html

The list has to be revised from time to time as the security of TLS
is re-evaluated by security research.
