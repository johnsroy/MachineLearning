1. add layout-sw600dp to support 7” tablets (600dp wide and bigger)
2. add layout-sw720dp to support 10” tablets (720dp wide and bigger)
Older versions of the platform will ignore the new qualifiers,
so we should mix them as needed to ensure the app looks great on any device
we can do like below
3. add layout-xlarge to support pre-3.2 tablets, and
layout-sw600dp to support 3.2 and up tablets.

FYI, http://developer.android.com/about/versions/android-3.2.html#api.
