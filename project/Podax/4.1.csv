Using com.android.music.MediaButtonIntentReceiver as a starting point,
hook up the headset button for pausing and resuming playback.

By registering the receiver in the manifest with a stupidly high
priority (5000; SYSTEM_HIGH_PRIORITY is supposed to be 1000), we can
prevent Google Music from simply kicking into gear. We should play nice
with other apps, but one step at a time.

In theory, long-pressing the headset button should skip forward, but
isLongPress() appears to never be true at the moment. That, also, can
wait for later; for now, just having the ability to pause & resume is a
win.

Given that preferences now control more than just downloading behaviour,
they should be available from all tabs in the app. Given that the
preferences won't be used very often, put the entry into the menu
overflow area, per the Android Design Guidelines.

For the same 'unlikely to be used often' rationale, we should consider
moving the 'About' tab into a separately launched activity, and launch
it from the menu overflow as well.
