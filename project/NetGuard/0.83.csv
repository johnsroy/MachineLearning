Setup:

- download dnscrypt-proxy compiled for Android from https://dnscrypt.org/
- copy the following files to /system/xbin using recovery:

-rwxr-xr-x root     root       224320 2016-02-03 14:44 dnscrypt-proxy
-rwxr-xr-x root     root       130432 2016-02-03 14:40 hostip
-rwxr-xr-x root     root       268196 2016-02-03 14:40 libsodium.so

- make these files executable (chmod 755)
- copy dnscrypt-resolvers.csv to /sdcard//Download/dnscrypt/
- run this script from the shell:

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH='/system/xbin'
dnscrypt-proxy -a127.0.0.1:5353 --loglevel=7 --resolver-name='dnscrypt.org-fr' --resolvers-list=/sdcard//Download/dnscrypt/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv

- make sure you set an IPv4 DNS server in NetGuard
- note that Android caches DNS responses for 10 minutes
- profit!
