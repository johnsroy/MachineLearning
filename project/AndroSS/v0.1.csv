Able to take screenshots, but only of itself for now. Works perfectly on the
Droid; color is off on the N1.

Refactored takeScreenshot to require a context in which to toast. Having that
function static may be entirely wrong, but for now, this is an improvement.

Base64 wasn't introduced until API lvl 8, so just copying the one class makes it
possible to target lvl 7 and possibly lower.

screenshots for a single shake of the phone are much less likely.
