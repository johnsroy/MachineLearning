versions as well as Android Marshmallow which dropped the

than API level 17 that support the textAlign attribute.

- Instead of a previous implementation of checking if the Samsung
ALLSHARE_CAST permission was granted to me, just catch
SecurityException when starting this activity. This fixes a scenario
where the permission may not be granted to this app, but actually
isn't necessary. This way, we only show an error if the settings
activity truly cannot be launched.

- Do not target the launch Intent directly to com.android.settings, for
some devices that package name is not maintained.
- Query PackageManager for system applications that match the
IntentFilters instead of limiting by package name. This ensures that
third party apps are never launched for the cast settings
IntentFilter.
