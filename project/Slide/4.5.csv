The general strategy is to take the raw HTML such as

blah <code>x = 1</code> cats

and map it to

blah <code>[[&lt;[x = 1]&gt;]]</code> cats

Then apply Html.fromHtml, which produces

blah [[<[x = 1]>]] cats

Using these tokens, the text can be parsed and a monospace font can
be applied.

The transform of the CharSequence to a string in the setCodeFont
method is to simplify the process of search for the tokens, though
it could probably be implemented using the mutable nature of
SpannableStringBuilder. Performance wise there is probably not a huge
hit since we are parsing relatively small amounts of text.

When the app loaded all posts for a subreddit, SubredditPosts.nomore
is set to true, which in turn alters the output of SubmissionAdapter.getItemCount
to just be {number of posts} (not {number of posts + 1} or 0).

However, the ViewHolder with the loading spinner still exists in the
RecyclerView, so the exception is thrown since our reported number of
items is {number of posts}, but the RecyclerView has {number of posts + 1}
items.

This solution adds the nomoreposts.xml which replaces loading spinner
with a 'No more posts!' message, and alters the SubmissionAdapter.getItemCount
method return either 0 or posts.size() + 1 (so it always accounts for
footer element).

Some refactoring was also applied to make code a bit more readable.

This has been tested on subreddits that use
- #s
- /s
- /sp
- /spoiler

as spoiler identifiers. The effect is that the visible text is
displayed as a link, with a whitespace, then the spoiler text
blacked out. When the visible text the clicked, the text of the
spoiler text is reset to white, with the backgroud to stay black.

This is a bit fragile due to the fact that:
1. subreddits use different hrefs for spoiler tags,
2. the visible spoiler text is different per subreddit (and even
per post).

Accordingly, there are a few assumptions. Firstly:

A1. Spoilers are identified by the presence of the 'title' attribute
within the <a> tag.

This seems consitent with the html that comes out of reddit, and
is used in the regex to find each spoiler.

A2. The text within the spoiler does not end in ']]'.

The whole parsing token is ']s]]', but this is relaxed to just ']]'
since it may or may not happen. Should probably be strengthed in
the future.

A3. If the title attribue is empty, insert 'spoiler' as the visible
text.

This is fairly self-explanatory, since having no title will mean
there is nothing to click on.

If more patterns need to be added to identify spoilers, see
ImageType.getImageType(String url).

To prevent collapsing of the children tree when a spoiler link is pressed,
ActiveTextView.spoilerClicked is set to true and is checked in the onClick
function in CommentAdapter for the R.id.content element.

Some amount of code clean up was added, since there were a lot of
inconsitent spacing issues and a few indents which could be reduced
by re-wording if statements.
