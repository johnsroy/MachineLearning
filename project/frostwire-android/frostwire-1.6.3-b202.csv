After we made OfferUtils ortogonal, I've proceeded to formalize the

`Affiliate` interface as well as a `InterstitialListener` interface.

I've broken all the static methods that existed in `OfferUtils`, now
called `Offers` and created `Affiliate` implementations for each one
of the sdks.

Made AppLovin try to load a new ad 30mins later if no fill on the
previous ad request. (like InMobi)
