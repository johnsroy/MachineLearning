Curves memory usage in hopes to avoid Out of memory error being reported. Before committing this I tried doing the whole thing with a deep WeakReference based refactor, only to read that after Android 2.3 they fixed the garbage collector with respect to how they were handling Bitmap references. My guess is that users reporting the Outofmemory error probably have an older version of android, therefore, this caching should somewhat help since we avoid the re-creation of new Bitmap objects.
