java.lang.IllegalStateException: not connected to MediaScannerService
at android.media.MediaScannerConnection.scanFile(MediaScannerConnection.java:164)
at com.frostwire.android.gui.UniversalScanner$AndroidScanner.onMediaScannerConnected(UniversalScanner.java:145)
at android.media.MediaScannerConnection.onServiceConnected(MediaScannerConnection.java:249)

Q: Is it wise to use a single media scanner object/connection and disconnection per file?

Looking at the implementation of scan, we are not reusing the MediaScanner connection,
we're connecting and disconnecting for each file, this is probably causing issues when
downloads are finished, issues which I've witnessed, torrents that finish and the files are never
there, perhaps thanks to this IllegalStateException.

I propose a refactor of Librarian.scan(File file, Set<File> ignorableFiles).

I believe the algorithm should first perform a walk of the directory until it's maximum depth and
put all files on a list. Then pass this list to the AndroidScanner, and scan them all using the same
connection, also avoiding the use of stack memory with each recursive call to scan.

I've implemented such algorithm with a new utility method on FilenameUtils.getFolderFiles() which walks
a directory non-recursively (saving stack and 20% faster than the recursive older version).

I've also refactored UniversalScanner, I've renamed the older 'AndroidScanner' to 'SingleFileAndroidScanner' and I've created a new one called 'MultiFileAndroidScanner'
This one takes the flattened collection of files and scans each one with the same MediaScannerConnection
object. I understand that each time the scanner finishes scanning a file it invokes a method of its
MediaScannerConnectionClient called 'onScanCompleted()', in the old implementation this method would disconnect, now what I do is I keep count of how many files have finished scanning, once all files
have finished scanning I then trigger the disconnection. I think there's a risk in case of error on which onScanCompleted is not called and the disconnection from the MediaScanner never happens.
If connection.scanFile() is not asynchronous, then it's easy because we can disconnect when we're done,
but judging for the older code, you disconnected only after receiving the callback.

please review.

This error was exploding when setLength was trying to allocate a huge array.
Calling .setLength(0) is not enough by looking at its code, however calling trimToSize
will reduce the backing array since we've set its count attribute to zero.
