The android RadioButton's are pretty limited, you cannot set the orientation of the text unless you have an inner layout for the radio button. In this case, instead of moving the text I've not used a background but instead a drawable and used gravity to position the text. I've played with the style. This won't work in landscape mode though. Gotta discuss a final, simple and elegant solution.
