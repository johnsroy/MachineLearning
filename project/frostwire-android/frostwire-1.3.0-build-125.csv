When we pause the VuzeManager, now we pass a 'disconnected' flag. If we are stopping due to disconnection, then those torrents that are not already 'STOPPED' will be marked as 'QUEUED'.
The Vuze documentation says the QUEUED state is precisely for this purpose. QUEUED is the same as STOPPED but with the only difference that it can be restarted automatically.

If the user is on a mobile connection (3G/4G), a few seconds after the transfer starts, it will go to Queue state and a long toast will be shown letting the user know what's going on.
In the event the torrent transfer starts on a mobile connection and the preference is to not care about data consumption, a warning message and tip to check for Preferences is shown. This should address some complains from users that can't seem to tell when they're on Wi-Fi vs 3G/4G.

Needs a bit more testing, specially on the part where the Queue transfer is supposed to start automatically when the Wi-Fi network is available.
