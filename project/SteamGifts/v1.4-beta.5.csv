Building with Travis was, historically speaking, as much of a gamble you could
imagine. Builds would randomly fail, while f-droid would always manage to
build them without an issue. Restarting failed builds manually, however, always
seemed to 'fix' the issues encountered before.

As such, the build status indicator by travis-ci is highly unreliable and does
not actually indicate whether or not the current build is broken. As a rule of
thumb, however, all commits on the 'master' and 'stable' branches should always
compile.
