This effectively is only applicable if your upgrade path looks like x.y-beta.z -> x.y while using chocolate as main flavor, which is only applicable/recommended to developers. Otherwise, installing 1.2 over 1.2-beta.1 would be a 'downgrade'.

Non-developers are unaffected by this, as beta and stable versions are not using the same package name; and stable versions were always using a higher version code.
