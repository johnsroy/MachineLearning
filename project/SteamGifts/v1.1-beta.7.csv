Viewing the discussion list indicates if the discussion has an associated poll.

Viewing a single discussion adds three different types of elements under the card view, but above the actual comments:
* a header for the poll to show the actual question
* a list of selectable answers, with the ability to vote for a single one
* a separator saying '-- comments --' before the actual comments

fixes #15

SteamGifts has a tendency to cut off the title in the giveaway list views, so those aren't reliable. Instead we fetch the page's title for single giveaway pages, which is the only way to get the full game title. No attributes or anything indicate otherwise.
