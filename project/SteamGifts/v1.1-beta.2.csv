As of this change, paged fragments have a floating action button to scroll to top. Instead of relying on loadItemsInitially for paged fragments, this value is now determined by whether or not the current fragment is active in the relevant FragmentStatePagerAdapter.

If it is not, the FAB is not changed. If the current fragment is active, we set the click listener to scroll up in the current fragment. Beforehand, a FragmentStatePagerAdapter could have changed the scroll click listener even if it wasn't the active fragment, often appearing as 'does nothing'.

There's still an issue with the ListFragment not properly recreating the FloatingActionButton if the instance is recreated. If we're on a pager with 3+ pages though, it is possible to see the FAB again by swiping to a page that was not the direct neighbor.

Dismissing a message ensures the message itself and all older messages will no longer be shown in any notification.

Ignoring a message until a new message arrives, without dismissing it, will still stack it into multiple messages.
