Changed the layout, so it doesn't use 'magic numbers'.
Changed the way we pass parameters between fragments, no more 'parsing int to string to convert them back to int'.
Improved (a bit) error handling.

This is still ugly, not commented, without any of the ideas of Java coding.
But it seems to work on my Galaxy S4 (miracle!!!).
Doesn't work on Genymotion though (tested with Android 5.1) :'(

Ah, and by the way, I think the functions/drawPOI.java is useless...
