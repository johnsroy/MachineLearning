As the backgrounds we have are squared, we modify the way we display them:
Instead of doing a setBackground() on the root view (which uses a
scale type FIT_CENTER), we now have an ImageView which displays the
background image.

And we specify a scale type of CENTER_CROP.

Also update the bg_fox background to the square image and do some code
cleaning in MainActivity
