What's New since v0.54:
* Added translations for 38 languages.
* Raised the minimum supported Android platform to Android 7
(Android 2.1, Eclair).
* Streamlined the design of the main screen.
* Added protection against the SQLite journal vulnerability CVE-2011-3901.
* Display a deprecation notice in the main screen of the app. The notice urges
users to switch to the new Authenticator app
(com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) which will securely import the key
material from this app if it's v0.91 or higher.

What's New since v0.91:
* Made the UI look more native, especially on Honeycomb and above.
* Grouped Scan Barcode and Manually Enter Account functionality into a
separate Add Account screen.
* Changed package name -- this is a new app as far as the Android OS and
Google Play are concerned. The app securely imports data from the 'old'
app (v0.91).

What's New since v2.15:
* Enabled the app to generate correct time-based (TOTP) verification codes
even on devices where the system time is wrong. The user can synchronize
the app's internal time with Google servers using Settings ->
Time correction for codes -> Sync now.
NOTE: This feature adds requirement for the Full Internet Access
permission.
* Made the countdown indicator and the Get Next Code (HOTP) button green
instead of gray (on Gingerbread and below only).
