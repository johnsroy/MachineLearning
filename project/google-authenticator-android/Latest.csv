Uses Gradle build flavors to distinguish between the productive
release version and the current development version, in order to allow
parallel installation of a productive version and a development version
on the same device.

Adjusts all themes.xml to not use qualified name to allow build of
flavor with different applicationId but same package name
(see http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/applicationid-vs-packagename
and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28159281/android-gradle-applicationid-setting-causing-no-resource-found-in-themes-xml).

Also replaces hard-coded references to package name in XML files for
preferences.

Instrumentation tests are hard-coded against the 'openSourceDev' flavor,
as this flavor is used for the test runner in the current configuration.

Drop support for API 7 (Eclair) as it has less than .1% market share on the Play Store.
Extend support all the way up to API 22 (Lollipop_MR1).
Since Eclair support is dropped, the Mockito workaround for testing is deleted also.
Additionally, to make the project work with the latest Android Studio, the test manifest is deleted.

Some very popular alternative keyboards have started to ignore the
'textNoSuggestions' hint and provide auto-completion nonetheless.
Adding the 'textVisiblePassword' hint works around this in many cases.

This is important, because adding the key to a potentially backup-ed and
possibly cloud-synced auto-completion set of keyboard will result in the
key no longer being secret.
