Before logs were copied either by shell commands or redirection, which made the app dependent
on knowing how to access the external storage via both user and root context.
Now, run the commands and grab/write the output in the Java userspace code, whcih eliminates the whole need
for the 'root path'

Currently, the app thinks theres an error eaach time you run the app - this needs to be fixed

I modified the TermSession to use libsuperuser to run logcat,
and show each line as soon as it comes. By skipping the whole buffer and character reading,
preformance is significantly faster.
Also, I stripped the writing to the process commands because they aren't used in this use case
