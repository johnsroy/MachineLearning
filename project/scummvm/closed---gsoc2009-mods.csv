So far all our detection code was based on FSNode, but since SCI seems to call engine internal code for detection which operates via File, there was the need to use File::addDefaultDirectory to have it working. The problem here is that the default directories are not reset after game detection, since the caller code assumes it's all done via FSNode. A simple change to use SearchMan, which is used internally by File, to add the default directory and removing it later on in the SCI detection code fixed the issue. Of course that is still slightly of a HACK, but it is much nicer than to rewrite engine internal code to use FSNode, just to be usable for game detection. I added a possible solution to remove the HACK as sourcecode comment.
