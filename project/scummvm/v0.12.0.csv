- Changed savegame loading related functions to use SeekableReadStream
rather than InSaveFile so MemoryReadStream can be used transparently.
- Fixed loadResourcesFromSave to load multiframe animations correctly
and to load 0.11.0/0.11.1 Future Wars savegames which used a slightly
different format.
- Added a savegame format detector that tries to detect between the old
Future Wars savegame format, the new one and a broken revision of the
new one.
- Changed makeLoad to first load the savegame fully into memory and only
then handle it (If the savegame's packed then it's unpacked first). If
the packed savegame can't tell its unpacked size (i.e. it's using zlib
format) then we'll try to load up to 256kB of the savegame data.
Thanks to wjp for his help with nailing this release critical bug.
