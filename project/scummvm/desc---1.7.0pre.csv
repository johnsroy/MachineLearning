This occurs because previously when the current version was equal
to a tag i.e. v1.7.0, the output of git --describe was shortened.
This ensures that the output is of the form v1.7.0-0-gXXXXX even
when the revision is equal to the tag.

2. Always enable _native_mt32 if Roland GS mode is selected. I don't know why I never did this originally, since _enable_gs is automatically disabled for SCUMM v6+ games that use General MIDI tracks instead of MT-32 music.
3. Set master tune for GS devices to 442.0kHz. This is the master tune setting for the MT-32.

Formerly the frequency was at 10000Hz. This resulted in 3,4 or even only 1
sample to be generated between callbacks on my system. All the other MIDI
drivers use a much lower frequency here. The MidiDriver_Emulated subclasses
use a frequency of 250Hz (by default) and the MidiDriver_MPU401 subclasses
(which are for example the ALSA output) use 100Hz. With the new frequency
of 250Hz 128 samples are generated between callbacks. This will hopefully
reduce the overhead of the MT-32 emulator (the engine's code was run 10000
times a second too) a bit.

I talked with KingGuppy and it seems the value was increased in the past
(still with the very old MT-32 emulator code) because there were accuracy
issues. However, I gave the lower frequency a quick test with the MI1, MI2
and ITE intro and didn't spot any obvious differences. As a result, KingGuppy
and I agreed to lower it back to 250Hz. If there are any problems coming up
we can still slightly increase the frequency to 1000Hz for example.

Thanks to waltervn for noticing this. Thanks to KingGuppy for discussion.

This reverts the changes done to the DW2 entries in commit d4a354c1.

We only distinguish between floppy and CD versions if a game had both a
CD and a floppy version released. DW2 was only released as a CD version,
so the extra flagging of the DW2 entries as CD was redundant, and caused
confusion regarding previous saved games to users that readded the DW2

This is a regression from f4ba8a6485b097a8ef1e2004d1af127243f379f1. The
commit replaced the static cosine and sine tables with dynamically created
ones. In the process of that a copy&paste error happened which made the sine
table use the layout of the cosine table. This commit now changes the
dynamically created sine tables to conform to the layout of the previous
static tables.

SmackerPlayer now creates a surface in the constructor and deletes it in the destructor.

This is imo nicer than to remove/add the surface.
I kept the several openSmacker since it wraps some code which is nice.

This looks to be a logic error in the constructor of module 2400, since
all the other modules do not create scenes with the global entrance
number when they are instantiated without an entrance (i.e. when
loading). With that logic error, all the code that handled Kleymen's
entrance to a scene after restoring was incorrectly skipped

DefaultEventManager registers a keymapper that is supposed to be

keymapper, but because the autofree flag is already set,
registerMapper() ends up deleting the event recorder itself. Setting
the autofree flag before actually freeing the mapper fixes the issue
and prevents ScummVM from crashing on startup

There are a few behavior changes introduced with this commit:

- checkThumbnailHeader will now also report the presence of

- skipThumbnail will also try to skip the data for broken/unsupported
thumbnail data.

- loadThumbnail will skip over broken/unsupported thumbnail data but still
return 0 in this case.

Uses the fact that 4*480*480 == 225 << 12, and the identity
(a*b)>>n == (a>>n)*b + ((a%(1<<n))*b)>>n (assuming non-overflowing math),
except the rhs uses smaller intermediate values and does not overflow(*).
Compared to the original code, this uses 1 fewer division and eliminates
the rounding error.

(*) Technical note: In some cases the right hand side of the above
identity still has possibilities of intermediate overflow, but only if
b > (1 << n), or if (b << n) overflows, neither of which are true here.

I think this is the correct thing to do, and that it won't have

Cases 29 and 30 happen in the first half of the game, in the
cantine, while case 42 happens in the second half of the game. By
the time you reach the point where case 42 does something, I don't
think it's possible to get back to cases 29 and 30, so when case
29 falls through neither 30 nor 42 will do anything.

This implements the original AD output and enables it for Indy3 and Loom DOS.
It is not enabled for Monkey Island DOS because it would break multi MIDI
support. However, there are also drawbacks for Indy3. In the catacombs
we were able to play sfx (Indy walking around) and the background music
at once. This was not supported in the original player and thus also does
not work with this reimplementation.

This fixes bug #2027877 'INDY3: Non-Looping Sound Effects'.
This fixes bug #1159581 'ADLIB: Adlib Emulation doesn't Respect Volume Settings'
for Indy3 and Loom.

This should have no effect on common/math.h as scummsys is included at
the top anyway, but this will fix compilation on some toolchains when
strict ANSI language compliance is enabled i.e. -std=c++11, rather than
-std=gnu11.

This causes an issue as a side effect is to set a guard which disables
various non-standard defines in the system headers i.e. the M_PI and
M_SQRT1_2 constant definitions in the MinGW x86_64 toolchain on
buildbot.

By moving this into scummsys.h after the point of system math.h
inclusion, we can ensure that M_PI etc. are always present.

important.

Reimplementation of 7a49802c01b0c39be4e86335689db8f3359fde68

This is based on a suggestion made by clone2727, so the original
idea belongs to him.
Engines can now override the common AVI audio track handler with a
custom one. This is needed for the Z-Engine AVI videos, since they
use a custom audio decoder that is only used in the two Z-Engine
games, and has its own fake AVI audio format (17). This clashes with
the MS IMA ADPCM format, and therefore shouldn't pollute the common
AVI video decoder code. The addition of this over-ridable method
allows the Z-Engine to add its own custom AVI decoder while avoiding
code duplication.

I think it's less error-prone this way if the code is ever modified.

Clicking on any of the image boxes would fall through to the case
where it checks if you are picking up or putting away the white
page, which just doesn't make any sense. It didn't have any
noticeable impact on the game, because that case only does
something if the hiding place for the white page is open, and
apparently that can only happen while you're at that hiding place.

I have verified that it's still possible to get the white page,

http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/TagNames/JPEG.html#Adobe

To still support Groovie's need for YUV data I added some possibility to
request direct YUV output.

Due to the math of the Panorama/Tilt, all pixel offsets are going to be closer
to the center of the image. Also, mutateImage is now being called on a
finished buffer, rather than an image at a time. Therefore, it no longer has to
handle image wrapping. Thus, there is no case in which a pixel offset would
be outside the image bounds.

This branch first implements the new iterator logic next to the old drawnum
logic, adding asserts that they produce identical results to facilitate testing

This fixes two issues:

* The rendering rectangle was not rotated, causing garbage to be
drawn if the rotated rectangle did not fully cover the unrotated
rectangle, or sprites to be clipped in the opposite case.

* The order of mirror/scale/rotation operations was inconsistent.
This commit does scaling first, followed by rotation. (This is only an
issue because scaling is specified separately in X and Y directions.)
For now only FIXMEs are added for mirroring.

This is mostly aimed at old graphics chips. For example, wjp's old laptop
only supports 1024x1024 textures but has a 1280x800 screen. Switching to
fullscreen would create a bigger overlay than supported. Now it will get
limited to an smaller resolution and then scaled too.

Alternatively we could think of tiling surfaces into textures. But then
handling scaling would be more complicated since it might result in

This decoder needs to keep track of client parameters that control
how the pixels are going to be packaged, so the responsibility for
clearing the state has been moved on the client (using the destroy()
method on ImageDecoder).

As no client uses the IFFDecoder for more than one image at a time,
this change does not require updates to the engines. The only effect
is on Parallaction (BRA-Amiga), which can now control the way pixels
are packaged in mask and path bitmaps.

This is to fix bug #3615148 -  'ALL: sscanf('%f'), atof() etc. not
portable due to Locale'

The side effect of setlocale('') is to change the active locale
from the default of 'C' to the detected system locale, but this
changes the behaviour of sscanf() and several other functions
in a system dependent and non-portable way. This has caused
bugs in the ZVISION engine when running Zork Nemesis.

The solution is to restore the default 'C' locale after the call
to get the language.

Thanks to criezy for working out this fix.

This is due to the multiple outputs produced by the configure rule,
which cause multiple invocations of configure when make is run in
parallel. Various solutions are detailed in the Multiple-Outputs
section of the GNU automake manual which apply generally to makefiles.

This solution is a simpler one, but should solve the problem, though it
can fail on 'mutilated' trees ie. where some of the configure outputs
are present, but not all... but this situation is not common, tends to
be due to an error in configure and should be recoverable by a
'make clean && ./configure' call.

The old computation had rounding issues, causing alpha to leak into
the red (usually) component.  There's a much easier way to compute it
that does not lead to such problems:  What should really happen is that
the two top bits of the A component should be set to 1 (thus adding
75% alpha).  So compute it that way for speed and precision.

The original alpha computation formula had a problem:  If something was
drawn on top of a pixel that was already fully opaque, there would be
an overflow in the computed alpha, and the destination alpha would be
truncated to 0 (fully transparent).

In commit 264ba4a9 this formula was replaced with another one, which
did not have overflows but also was not correct.

This commits introduces a new formula, where the rounding errors have
been turned in another direction; drawing a fully opaque pixel on top
of a transparent one would result in a pixel which is almost, but not
fully, opaque.  However, this is no problem in practice, since drawing
fully opaque pixels can be achieved with much less code as a special
case, so add that (also improves rendering speed).

These issues were identified by the STACK tool.

By default, the C++ new operator will throw an exception on allocation
failure, rather than returning a null pointer.

The result is that testing the returned pointer for null is redundant
and _may_ be removed by the compiler. This is thus optimization
unstable and may result in incorrect behaviour at runtime.

However, we do not use exceptions as they are not supported by all
compilers and may be disabled.

To make this stable without removing the null check, you could qualify
the new operator call with std::nothrow to indicate that this should
return a null, rather than throwing an exception.

However, using (std::nothrow) was not desirable due to the Symbian
toolchain lacking a <new> header.
A global solution to this was also not easy by redefining 'new' as 'new
(std::nothrow)' due to custom constructors in NDS toolchain and various
common classes.

Also, this would then need explicit checks for OOM adding to all new
usages as per C malloc which is untidy.

For now to remove this optimisation unstable code is best as it is
likely to not be present anyway, and OOM will cause a system library
exception instead, even without exceptions enabled in the application
code.

As an alternative to using the Screen class's functions, we can let
the VQA decoder draw directly to the backend. This won't work if the
game uses 'hi-res mode', but I don't think that's ever the case for
Malcolm's Revenge. I believe the KyraEngine_MR::playVQA() function
ensures that the screen is properly updated after the movie has
finished.

This almost limits the VQA rewrite to vqa.cpp and vqa.h. Whether it's
better this way than changing the Screen functions to take a 'pitch'
parameter...? I don't know. But it's an alternative.

Untangled the audio and video track from each other, and the parsing

as it turns out deleting a Surface doesn't free its data. You have to
call free() in it.

I have only checked the intro, not every cutscene, but that seems to
work fine at least.

Formerly the taskbar support was *always* enabled except when the backend or

backends which do not have any taskbar support (like DC, Tizen and probably
more which simply did not disable it so far) when defaultErrorHandler was
called for example (Mass Add is also broken for those).
The SDL (and derived backends) worked around missing taskbar support by
simply faking a dummy taskbar implementation (but still claiming in configure
that we feature taskbar integration, ouch).

To avoid all non-SDL backends from manually specifying _taskbar=no I added
some auto detection code which simply only enables taskbar support in case
ScummVM is built on Win32 or libunity is present.

The target is not just a bare 'queen', but is postfixed by language
variant (and CD if used).

Using this for the savegame naming would be good as it allows several
language variants to have different co-existing savegame sets without
causing conflicts. However, if the savegame format is the same across
all language variants, then using the same naming allows easier
switching between languages if testing.

Currently the queen engine uses a single set of savegames named in the
format 'queen.sXX' which are used for all languages, as the format
appears to be compatible across language variants. This may require
changing in future, if a variant with incompatible savegame format
is discovered.

The only parts where we didn't were codepaths never
actually taken in the gob games, so for the sake of
clarity (and fixing Coverity issues), this commit removes
those as well.

This was introduced by fd3970aa52a0c7f411afdddfebad208f783281c8:
Apply patch #2984508 - 'GSoC: SCUMM stopped audio from playing while
saving'

This was not quite correct as if the save fails, the function exits
without unpausing the engine, which resulted in sound and music
remaining muted. This corrects the logic to unpause in all cases.

This pack contains just the 320x240 layout.

This is a quick way to achieve the result of a smaller keyboard
when running on 640x480 and larger games as requested bu a user.

To use this, the pack zip file, vkeybd_small.zip should be placed
in the extrapath in the same way as vkeybd_default.zip.

However, it is also necessary to set this as the active virtual
keyboard layout by adding the following linein the global [scummvm]
section of the configuration file i.e. scummvm.ini:
vkeybd_pack_name=vkeybd_small

This should be added to the GUI as a misc option, in future.

Currently, the closest layout size to the overlay size is chosen
automatically by the code in the method:
bool VirtualKeyboardParser::parserCallback_mode(ParserNode *node)

This should probably also be made configurable in future to allow
smaller keyboard sizes to be chosen.

The getKloggsTextIndex() function would return 40 twice in a row
when wrapping around. This caused one of Willie's nonsense letters
to appear instead, since they're supposed to trigger when
getTextIndex1() returns the same result more than once.

The same bug also appeared (and has been fixed) in getTextIndex3(),
but there it just caused the same nonsense letter to appear twice.

This shouldn't be a problem, as current client code either must find a
terminator when parsing the byte buffer or have preknowledge of the
buffer size from a file size or fixed call, so the appended null
termination will not cause issues. This change thus allows client code
to add sanity checks to prevent reading off the end of the buffer.

This prevents this crash and any other in future, though it does not

Have simplified the parsing of the COMPUTAN.TXT file prior to looking at

These change should have no functional difference, but improve the code
by removing a set-but-unused bool in the MenuItem structure, fixing a
number of repeated 'magic' values to be explicit as various buffer sizes
and replacing usage of strcpy with the safer version from our Common
code etc.

This is a first step towards a AdLib support level we had when we tried to

sound effects properly, i.e. they still sound like in the original.
