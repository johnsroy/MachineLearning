Hopefully it will solve a bunch of memory leak problems.
Now Spare is a central container, which stores pointers to every Sprite currently used by the engine.
Because of that, there's no more need for Queue's clear().
In case of snKill(), it's just a safeguard, since it's only used by the engine to 'kill' the speech bubbles, but we will check Spare anyway, so it's the safest this way.

This keeps the original MUNT code in showLCDMessage/printDebug and simply

is no need to adapt the default implementation.

This is not the cleanest way but the solution which requires the least changes
to MUNT code.

This moves the AmigaOS4 specific packaging rules from the global
ports.mk to a port specific makefile in the AmigaOS subdirectory of
the SDL backend (used for AmigaOS).

Previously, port specific makefiles were only used for cross compiling
builds and thus had a single entry in the cross compiling section of
the configure. Since AmigaOS4 is a desktop system supporting native
build, this required a second entry for when the host system is detected
as ppc-amigaos to support native builds.

However, currently this does break packaging of cross compiled builds
for Win32, OSX and Unix when done on AmigaOS4... but this is not likely
and has limited impact. To fix this, default _port_mk lines would need
to be added to the sections of the cross compiling switch for mingw32
etc. to override the AmigaOS4 OS setting of _port_mk.

Because of the way the speech is compressed with duplicate samples
being stored with a negative size and a single value, when reading the
data with the wrong endianess we can end up with a lot of duplicate
samples which biased the result with the way the old heuristic was
coded. Hopefully this change to skip duplicate samples will make it
more robust.

Moved the creation of _midiMusic, _pcmMusic, _sound and _bmv from
the constructor to run(). It was reported on the forum that the
MT-32 emulator didn't work for Discworld, and I'm speculating that
this is because it was being initialized before the 'extra path'
had been added to the search path.

It's likely that not all of these objects are needed for every
version of the game. Fixing that is left as an exercise for
someone more familiar with the different game versions than me.

Fixes bug # 6771

We don't need to change locations, since we use the ScummVM save dialog instead
of the original one (which is actually a location). Instead we just need to reset _nextLocation to
_currentLocation so the engine can stop trying to save. If we change locations, the
StateKey_LastWorld/Room/etc. end up being overwritten with the current room. So if a script
refers to location 0, 0, 0, 0 (aka, the last room), the engine will try to change location to the same room.

SCI1 sound resources can have an embedded priority. We now use that by
default, unless an explicit DoSound/SetPriority call overrides it.
Thanks waltervn.

This fixes relative priority of songs in at least PQ3 room 29.

Also increase savegame version to 33.

Fixed Wintermute incorretly parsing folder names with trailing \

(Windows-only issue)
It seems that calling getParent returns trailing '\' which is absent on POSIX based file systems but not on Windows. This causes Wintermute to load outline_red2.font from russian.dcp, which is not desired. This is fixed by calling it->getName() directly, which returns the folder name (without the trailing '\').

I thought that having unsigned coordinates makes sense, but
for some reason, Fascination sets _destSpriteX (which maps
to left in fillRect()) to -1, expecting the drawing code to
clip.

We set a custom video mode that might have a different BPP from the default. To ensure that other graphics managers will get the proper results when listing available video modes, we need to restore the initial BPP when unloading.

This fixes an issue when switching to OpenGL on Windows 8 and later. On those OSes, fullscreen OpenGL only has a 32bpp mode. It is correctly listed in the options but we call SLD_SetVideoMode later in the surface graphics manager. When we list the mode again after a switch, the internally selected BPP is still 16 and we fail to find any available fullscreen modes.

The way I've configured ScummVM, the default is to use FluidSynth
for MIDI, and any game where I want AdLib overrides that setting.
I have set the DOSBox OPL emulator as the default.

However, this causes the game's 'opl_driver' setting to be 'auto',
which overrides the default setting, and usually picks the MAME
OPL emulator. To counter this, if it sees that 'opl_driver' is
'auto', it will check the default setting.

In other words, only use 'auto' if 'opl_driver' isn't set on any
level. I think this is the behaviour that should cause the least
amount of astonishment.

This causes replies to once again be shown in their entirety,

There were two errors: First of all, _wait was always set to 1,
because one of the conditions was '|| _opcodes[OP_IF_STATEMENT]'
instead of '|| v == _opcodes[OP_IF_STATEMENT]'.

Secondly, judging by the older version, this part of the code
should only be allowed to set _wait to 1, never to 0, because we
may have already set it to 1 for other reasons.

As far as I understand, the Rose Tattoo music is standard XMIDI, so
it can be played on any GM device. The music now sounds like I
remember it from DOSBox. (I'm currently limited to AdLib music in
DOSBox, so I can't make any proper comparison.)

AdLib support currently depends on ScummVM's GM -> AdLib conversion,
so that does not match the original.

I'm not sure about MT-32, but since I have no reason to believe that
there is MT-32 specific music - at least not in the way the Serrated
Scalpel MT-32 driver expects - we can probably rely on our default
driver to a reasonable job of it.

- both known variants are supported (INSTR.DAT + MUSIC.DRV)
- INSTR.DAT/MUSIC.DRV holds channel mapping, instrument mapping, etc.
- fixed bug inside S1D MidiParser, that ruined some instrument changes
0xFC header was seen as 2 byte header, but it's 4 bytes in Elvira 2
and 5 bytes in Waxworks / Simon 1 demo
- dynamic channel allocation for the MUSIC.DRV adlib driver is not
implemented atm, simply because at least the demos of Waxworks and
Simon 1 do not use this feature
- sound effects of Waxworks are not implemented atm
- note: the game 'Altered Destiny' uses Accolade INSTR.DAT variant too

- also commented out implemented bug of INSTR.DAT/MUSIC.DRV
This bug only affected the adlib drivers, so I guess we should
rather fix it instead of implementing the same buggy behavior

screen is recopied at the end of rendering to apply the mask overlay,
so the tooltip needs to be redrawn after again in order to be seen

This is a left-over vestige of when the gob engine recorded the size
of each variable currently in use, because it byte-swapped all
variables on save/load depending on the machine ScummVM ran on.

The gob engine doesn't do that all anymore (instead, the variables are
always stored in the endianness of the original game), so
getAddressOff8() doesn't store 'this is an 8-bit variable' anymore,
making the call a NOP.

This fixes Coverity Scan issue #1267142.

Rose Tattoo did different font char mapping for at least
the German version of the game (can't verify anything else).
RT seems to map 0xE1 only, but to a different character
and other upper characters (>= 0x80) are not mapped at all.

this fixes broken special characters in RT.

Somewhat unusually, the cutscene for the monkey stealing Hodgkins
cap (wilb29a.tlk) is ended immediately after they both run off-screen,
but the characters aren't properly marked as hidden until several
seconds later when another script, 30cuend, is called. If a user
saved the game really quickly before 30cuend is fired, it can leave
the game in an in-consistent state. This commit fixes that by forcing
the WAIT cursor to remain active until 30cuend has executed.

This is what the original game does too, and the scripts query for
all-uppercase CD track names.

Interestingly, this being wrong has been mostly inconsequential. It
does, however, manifest in one bug in the underwater wreck level of
Gobliins 2. After calling the Moray Eel by lighting the lamp with
Winkle, speaking to said eel has the scripts wait for the currently
playing background track to end before playing the voice lines,
instead of ending the audio track forcefully. The track is only about
a minute long, so it's 'only' annoying, not a game-stopper.

The scripts also try to compare the CD track name with some different,
all-uppercase names, so this is possibly relevant in some other places
as well. No such bug report exists at the moment, though.

See also the forum post with the bug report:
http://forums.scummvm.org/viewtopic.php?p=81733#81733

A somewhat related bug report is #2999 'GOB2 : Moray Eel Game Freeze
(Wreck Scene)' (<http://sourceforge.net/p/scummvm/bugs/2999/>). At
that time, the script expression parser still did a stricmp for the
NEQ expression (which is wrong), and that made the bug not trigger.
Commit 5c58b9a3a4a8848474aba18c02c0da997fb138a2, which fixed that
incorrect NEQ behaviour, then made this bug here appear.

This is something I found when trying the savegame from bug #6932,
but I still don't know if it actually is that bug.

From what I understand, there are two different cases in the
moveCarToPoint() method: One where you click on a different
section on a track than you're on, and one where you click on the
same section on the track that you're on.

In the latter case, it sends message 0x2004 to the car, which is
then handled by AsCommonCar::handleMessage(). That one will assume
that the parameter is a point, but this can also be encoded as an
integer with 16 bits for the X coordinate and 16 bits for the Y
coordinate. See MessageParam::asPoint().

If we only pass an X coordinate to the message, the Y coordinate
is assumed to be 0, and we do this in a couple of places. I do not
know the exact implications of that, but in the two cases I've
changed here, it meant that clicking on the track below the car
would still make it go up, because it thought you were travelling
towards the top of the screen.

So I think this is the appropriate fix, but even if it is, I do
not know if it's enough or if it should be changed in other places
as well.

This likely fixes just about every remaining outstanding bug report.
The variable, for a savegame being loaded, was only reset when a
previously loaded scene was freed. But if you loaded a game directly
from the launcher, there was no previous scene to free, and the
variable remained set. Which meant that you could do things in the
scene and then either leave the scene or make another save without
the _sceneStats update method being called to reflect the changes
made in the change in the global flags.

According to johndoe it's correct to pass the entire coordinate,

tell any difference at all in the behavior, but I guess it doesn't
hurt either. After all, we can easily zero the Y coordinate, if we
ever want to.

The bug was caused by a check introduced by me to avoid division-by-zero errors
when the source and dest x values are equal.
This had the side effect that it didn't work well in this case outlined in the
bug report, maybe also in other places.
I'm not sure how to handle a DBZ correctly here so I'm setting the x delta to
1.0 if it would normally be 0.0, which seems to work after walking around
in some scenes.

As a side effect we get better coordinates from mouse move events in
fullscreen, i.e. we do not get actual window coordinates but something close
to actual viewport coordinates. The easily noticable issue is that mouse
coordinates inside black bars are outside of the viewport. For example, the
x coordinate can get negative when there's a black bar at the left side.

This is a pull request for the game The Labyrinth of Time. This game is
currently available on www.wyrmkeep.com and on GOG.com. The game should
be completable: it was completable a month ago and we did regularly
regression testing. All the work has been based on sources kindly
provided by Wyrmkeep.

The DOS and the Windows versions are supported by this engine.

This is a manual merge of the PR, with some history fixups.

The old code expected sciAudio FOpen calls to fail, because they
contained a directory name. On AmigaOS those calls succeeded.
Because of that at least on AmigaOS, sciAudio support didn't
work at all.

We now detect sciAudio FOpen calls and return a proper virtual file
handle. This should fix it on all platforms.

Also moved the SCI32 virtual save file handle from 200 to 32100.

Reasons:
- Shared objects aren't really shared on AmigaOS
(Once two programs load the same .so, it will be loaded twice into memory instead of sharing the already available one)
- To make the program run for everyone i need to provide a subdir (SObjs/) which holds all the .so's used while compiling, otherwise some people have to go hunting for the correct .so's online.
(That completely defies the use of 'shared objects')
Even worse is the fact that, if users have older .so's installed, they might experience crashes.
- There is no benefit in building ScummVM with shared objects, because even *if* a new lib version is available as an .so it won't be mandatory to immediately switch to it, because the code probably won't take advantage of it as fast.

In short:
Switchting to static builds to reduce user grief, crash reports and as a bonus have ScummVM start a little faster.

It seems Sierra did not check the key-modifier in kMenuSelect.
We do and that's why the code didn't recognize all sorts of
menu keys anymore.
We now isolate the lower byte before comparing.

I also noticed, that Sierra passed keyboard modifiers in mouse
events. This was probably done, so that owners of a 1-button
mouse were able to right-click. We do this now too.

Also added information about mouse modifiers in kGetEvent.

Moved the mouse modifier code into getScummVMEvent().
