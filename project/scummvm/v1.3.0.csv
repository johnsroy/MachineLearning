Instead of adding it, we just turn on the 'reverse alpha' feature for these bits. The problem was not making an exception for 5650.

This should fix bug #3295893.

The intention of this piece of code was to pad the first save slot
name with spaces until it's as long as the longest save slot name,
because the scripts use it to gauge the width of the save list.
Unfortunately, I messed up there, overwriting variable space directly
after the save names. In Urban Runner's case, this would be the list
of inventory items.
