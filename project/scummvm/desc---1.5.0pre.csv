This is a regression from 77c65648b1db8f8b7b245510681eafd856798d26.

Formerly the code used strtok to check for any audio related GUIO flag to be
present in _guioptions. Since strtok tokenizes the string this won't really
work. I changed it to use strpbrk, which searches a string for any character
from a set of characters (in our case flags). The code should now have the
same semantics as of before the above mentioned commit.

This also gets rid of copying the gui options into a char array and a strncpy
call.

GUIO_EGAUNDITHER is a positive flag unlike the rest of the GUIO
negative flags like GUIO_NOASPECT and GUIO_NOSPEECH.
This means the gui option is only enabled if the flag exists.

This caused the gui option to be disabled in the global options dialog due
to the flag not existing in the global confman domain.
It is an inconvenience and a regression IMHO to have to set this flag on
a game by game basis with no option to set it globally and have the games
override it.

Thanks Strangerke for making me clarify.

Thanks LordHoto for feedback on code style.

Now all VOCs are streamed rather than preloaded. This deprecates the
STREAM_AUDIO_FROM_DISK define, which was previously used to stream VOCs from
disk.

This might very well break some engines which relied on the stream not being
changed after makeVOCStream! I adapted all engines which had a check for
STREAM_AUDIO_FROM_DISK in their code.

It would be wise to check all other engines using VOC to see if this might
cause any problems for them.

This fixes sound corruption when using the new VOC streaming code. It also

it does not preload them into memory anymore. This comes at the expense of one
file descriptor needed per sfx being played though.

This is a slightly updated version of the patch I attached to the
bug report. Apparently, the DOS/Windows demo has a slightly different
set of sound resources than the full game. (There were also some
other minor differences in the sound effects list, but I didn't think
them worth the trouble to implement.) I've played through the demo,
and I didn't notice any problems.

Updating the screen when getMillis() % 10 is 0 seems sub-optimal
to me. It could be true several iterations in a row (shouldn't be
harmful, since updateScreen is assumed to be cheap if the screen
hasn't changed) or we could miss it every single time. Let's
measure the time between updates instead, just to be safer.

This bug is 'DRASCULA-IT: Crash/graphic glitch at castle towers'.
The crash was due to width and height values being passed to
copyBackground() being invalid due to out of bounds read from
the factor_red array. This adds debugging statements and fixes
the crash by clipping accesses to the maximum index of factor_red.

This doesn't however fix the observed GFX glitch, but stops it being
a segfault.

18e84f9c1138ea4ce66cbbea53e6957bee3e588f GUIO_MIDICMS used '\008' which
resulted in the CMS flag adding a zero into the flags and thus terminating the
GUIO flag string.

If you turn off the music and then save a game, then turn on the music
again and then load the saved game, the music from the scene continue
to play despite the _music flag being false. So the first time you click on
the music on/off button the music restart and only the second time
does it stop. This fixes the bug by stoping the music before reloading
a game.

This reverts commit 546c6a07e4803541647ad18d69c650fdd4cf974c.

This wasn't a good idea, after all - it breaks saves and the game
time is always the real time (which is not what the original did - it
only synced the game time with the real time at the beginning)

is interesting for the iPhone port, too.

On the long run, ScummVM will have to switch to the new API, as Apple
will eventually drop the old one.

Goto Considered Harmful...

The following commits should improve the ScummVM code structure by reducing the number of gotos used in various engine code.

They should implement identical functionality, but without using goto and without the result being less readable/maintainable than the version with goto.

The AppleII sound player works in two phases: writing samples to the
sample buffer (sample

output callback.
The sample buffer is read completely in the reading phase so the entries
of the already read samples of the buffer can be reused again during the
next write phase.

The streams that are created are now used directly instead of SAGA creating its own RawStream after decoding it. In addition, this should fix ADPCM-compressed sounds on big endian systems (as the code was treating the result of readBuffer() to always be LE, whereas it's actual native endian).

I've also clarified the bugfix to bug #1256701. It only applies to 16-bit PCM data and the size for other data is no longer truncated too ;)

The sound of trickling water in the spider lair is started, but never

tried it in DOSBox, it finally stopped when I got back to the Nexus.)
The same sound effect is used the underwater cavern, and in that case
the exit script does fade out the sound so this workaround emulates
that behaviour.

SCUMM: Work around spider lair script bug in The Dig

When entering the spider lair, the entry script may optionally start
the sound of running water. However, this sound is never explicitly
stopped, so it may continue for quite a while. (When I tried it with
DOSBox, it didn't stop until I got back to the Nexus.) This workaround
adds a fade-out to the sound when the exit script is about to run.
This is consistent with how that same sound effect is faded out in the
underwater cavern (room 33).

Note: the transition is not completed yet. The code compiles but is probably not runnable as not every occurrence of _activeInventory has been properly replaced.
The usage of _v0ObjectIndex and _v0ObjectInInventory should be revised too and both variables should be replaced by another mechanism (maybe by using a single variable 'obj = (type << 8) | id').

- moved v0 only vars _activeInventory, _activeObject, _activeVerb from  ScummEngine_v2 to ScummEngine_v0
- removed _activeActor, _activeInvExecute, _activeObject2Inv and _activeInventory. They are handled by _activeObject/_activeObjectType and _activeObject2/_activeObject2Type now.
- removed _activeObject(2)Index as they only bloat the code without any benefit (?)
- merge prep-name tables from ScummEngine_v2::drawPreposition() and ScummEngine_v0::drawSentenceWord() by introducing ScummEngine_v2::drawPreposition()
- rename ObjectData.flags -> obj_type (quick-fix only, needs review! Maybe obj_nr and obj_type can be merged into one var: obj_nr = (obj_type << 8) | obj_nr)
- o_unknown2 is negation of o_ifActiveObject (o_ifNotEqualActiveObject2)
- renamed o_ifActiveObject -> o_ifEqualActiveObject2 as it acts only on _activeObject2
- renamed ScummEngine_v0::drawSentenceWord() -> ScummEngine_v0::getObjectName()

In v0 this is not the case as there are objects with IDs like 3 and 5 (e.g. the hamster). So object ID handling was unified for v0 and the other engines by introducing objIsActor(), objToActor() and ActorToObj().

foreign variants still use 'DREAMWEB.*' for savegames, while using

this naming convention as this causes savegame collisions when multiple
language variants are present, which could cause issues.

The usages in the Room members of the constant g_roomData structure have
also been omitted, as the members are copied into the savegame format,
thus replacing these and fixing other accesses is not trivial.

Because the 'clear' buttons are very different between themes (in
the Modern theme they have a graphical symbol, while in the Classic
theme they have a letter), they have to be removed and re-added
when reflowing the layout. This is patterned after how the
LauncherDialog class handles the larger changes in layout.

Removing widgets from a tab turned out to be trickier than I first
thought, so I had to move the removeWidget() method from Dialog to
GuiObject.

I do not know whether this could be a problem on other backends, too.

The removal of the continue statement fixes the update of background

animation, but it also has the side effect of allowing hotspots to
respond during this period if the user clicks fast enough.

This is a workaround for how Lost in Time behaves in combination
with changes I made to the DataIO code for running Urban Runner
on low-memory devices.

Urban Runner's intro are far to big to have them copied into
memory for these devices, so I made the DataIO code return a
SafeSeekableSubReadStream into the opened archive stream instead.
Unfortunately, Lost in Time might not close a video file when it
closes the data file which it was originally in, especially when
loading a saved game. Since the video player needs to be able to
gaplessly continue a video and there does not, by itself, close
the video if not requested by the scripts, this leads to reading
out of an already closed stream in certain cases.

So, to worka round this issues, the video player tries to reopen
each currently opened video after a data archive was closed, to
make sure that that video is still available. If not, the video
is closed.

This is a complete rewrite of the AdLib players for ADL and MDY/TBR
files in the Gob engine.

Major changes
1) The AdLib base class is now completely separated from all file
format code and can theoretically be used by any OPL2-based
format (within reason)
2) The new code is far better documented and more readable
3) The MDY player now actually works. The MDY/TBR format is
in reality the MUS/SND format created by AdLib as a simpler
alternative to the ROL format
4) Since the MAME emulator is quite buggy and leads to noticable
wrong percussion in the Gobliins 2 title music, the new AdLib
player will try to create a DOSBox OPL. If it's not compiled in,
or if the user configured opl_driver to 'mame', it will print
out appropriate warnings.

Phantasmagoria's scripts keep polling for the existence of the savegame
index file and request to read and write it using the same parameters
when opening it. The index file is closed and reopened for every save
slot, which is slow and can be much slower on non-desktop devices.
Also, the game scripts request seeking in writable streams and request
to expand the existing index file.

To provide this functionality and to reduce constant slow file opening
and closing, this virtual class has been introduced

Shivers uses extra special hardcoded save files together with the normal
ones that are used to store slot names and spot descriptions. The scheme
is a bit odd, and since the names of the extra save files are hardcoded,
this scheme is problematic to use. We skip the creation of these files
altogether and use virtual files instead, which means that the
(broken) spot descriptions won't be visible next to each save
description. This isn't a major issue for now, and it's left as a future
TODO to implement this feature in a cleaner way, and not with extra save
files. This scheme fixes the slot descriptions in the loading screen.
Also, kCD(1) has been implemented, which fixes loading of the save
states themselves

The DOS, Amiga and Atari version of Little Red come with a small
screen, accessible through the main menu, that lets children read and
listen to animal names in 5 languages: French, German, English,
Spanish and Italian.

Unfortunately, the German names are partially wrong. This is
especially tragic because this is a game for small children and
they're supposed to learn something here. So I deem fixing this a
very good idea.

Just to be sure, someone should probably look over the French,
Spanish and Italian words too.

Using Ryan's watch within the game, the watch time always started at
19.30 from point of use, which did not seem correct.

Checking with the original CD and Floppy interpreters under DOSBox
showed they used the current system time, so this was incorrect.

Bisection shows that this regression was introduced by commit
57e940f67896e0f085de23088754fe1682cd49db i.e. 'DREAMWEB: Move all saved
variables to a GameVars struct' and was probably a side effect of a
minor call ordering change in the equivalent of setupInitialVars()
with respect to the getTime() call.

However, to ensure no further regressions, it was easier to fix this
by replacing the initial value setting by a getTime() call.

future reference
