it changes to the link. I'm guessing that the last frame in the animation

The original calls SetAlarm(&deltaAlarm[i], delta->timer) between each
frame, but amends itself by calling SetAlarm(&deltaAlarm[i], 0) when the
link happens. I'm trying to simulate that effect by using 0 as frame time
instead of anim->frame_time. I think that's the right thing to do.

* Added speechCoords to the SpeechData structure so that talking actors
don't drag their speech subtitles with them just because they're moving
and talking at the same time. (Could this also be useful for non-actor
speech?) If the actor has multiple strings, the coordinates are updated
for each new string.

* Made speechColor and outlineCoor arrays so that simultaneous speech (i.e.
where several actors are talking at the same time) multi-coloured. This
is completely untested, though.

* Used getBlack() to get the black colour for the text outline. The
original uses a constant, but we could always make getBlack() return
that constant, if we want to.

In this first step, I have moved all opcode functions into functions.cpp,
instead of having them scattered all over the place.

To get things to compile again, I had to rewrite the overly complicated
sound effects handling. It's much simpler now.

The next step will be to move any non-trivial code out of the opcode
functions and into the appropriate object. This, I hope, will make it
easier to create well-separated objects, instead of the current mess.

I also want to tear down the artificial boundary between the main directory
and the 'driver' directory. We already have a cross-platform layer; there's
no need to have yet another one. (Actually, the rewriting of the sound
effects code took one first step in this direction.)

At the final stage, I'd like to get rid of the 'drivers' directory
completely, but I'll probably need some help with that if I want to
preserve the CVS history of the code.

Things will probably be a bit bumpy along the way, but I seem to have
reached a point of relative stability again, which is why I'm commiting
this now.

Just I happened to have one demo with resource fork stripped from game binary.

strip it down. Now I fail with error message, but we may use some fallback.

At least we need to know a standard way of copying binary files with resources
unstripped and describe it in Mac HOWTO.

playing music from the same CD, they will both take turns at using the same

The only case where both file handles are used is when music from one CD is
fading in while music from the other CD is fading out. Which of course can
only happen if you play the game from hard disk. If the game has to ask for
the other CD, it kills the music immediately.

The reason for doing this is that there was some concern about whether
having two file handles open to the same file was portable or not. I don't
think that question was ever fully answered, so I avoid the situation.

I believe it's the wrong scene.

Currently we use resource 152, which run the scripts 'CampFireSetup' and
'CampFireScene'. If I use resource 151 instead it will run the scripts
'ColumnSetup' and 'ColumnScene' instead. I'm speculating that this is the
'hate' speech and the rest of the intro ('ColumnScene' is a fairly long
script, as far as I can tell), but unfortunately this causes ScummVM to
crash almost immediately.

I'll need to dissect the scripts to see if I can figure out what's wrong.

* Added support for most of the extended capabilities of the CM-32L/LAPC-I (more rhythm timbres, more rhythm key mappings, more PCM samples).
* The control ROM is now identified by searching for matching ID strings at various locations in the file. There are now a lot of safety checks to help ensure that a bad ROM will not crash the emulator.
* Three control ROM versions are now identified and mapped out - an original MT-32 control ROM, an original CM-32L ROM, and the Blue Ridge modified MT-32 ROM.
* Now supports the expression controller properly.
* Sustain is now turned off correctly again.
* 'All Notes Off' no longer stops notes held by the sustain controller.
* Implemented 'Reset all controllers'.
* Stereo pan positions are no longer inverted.
* Volume, pitch, filter and envelopes are now more accurately calculated. Overall, the sound emulation is much more accurate.
* Waveforms are now slightly more accurate (in terms of pitch), necessitating a regeneration.
* Handling of unusual sysex messages has been improved (fixes sysex messages from Java's MIDI classes on Windows).
* Fixed a reverb bug during periods of silence.

2. optimize NES audio generation a little bit - instead of calling a function ~80 times to get one audio sample, it calls it once and just loops ~80 times internally
3. NES audio now obeys the volume control
4. in MM NES, o2_setObjPreposition is a no-op
5. o2_lights uses new-style light values (i.e. bitfields) in MM NES
6. o2_delay, use ssPaused identifier rather than a literal '1'
7. in MM NES, o5_saveLoadGame only explicitly checks for type '1' (load), defaulting to save for any other value

close to each other on the ground. (Happened to me on the first level after
destroying the voodoo doll, where I'd drop the banana, the soap and the
false nose close to each other on the ground after using them.)

Reasoning behind the change:

From what I understand, map_itemsMap[] contains information for each 'cell'
of the map about which objects are there. Each cell can contain two objects
which are stored in the upper and lower byte of a 16-bit word.

When dropping an object, it is written into map_itemsMap[], but not just to
the indicated cell but also to a few of the surrounding ones. Presumably to
make it easier to pick it up afterwards.

When writing an object to a cell, we check if one of the bytes is already
occupied. If it is, write to the other byte. Otherwise, write to that byte.
(If both bytes are occupied, one will be overwritten.)

The old code assumed that if one byte was free at position (x,y) the same
byte would automatically be the free one in the surrounding cells. This
could cause bad values in the array, since the item was added to an
existing value, rather than replacing it.

This new code makes the check for each cell that is modified. (It also gets
rid of some code duplication.)

which I'm very grateful.

This latest CD version turned out to be one that ScummVM didn't support. It
has - I believe - the same data files as the Linux version (with digitized
music), except for the voice file which appears to be the same as the one
from the Mac version.

In other words, it has one big-endian data file, and a couple of little-
endian ones. The technical term for this is 'bloody awkward'.

It should work now, though.

English and German at the same time. I've simplified the handling a bit by
splitting the line flags into language and... not-language? platform? since
this was easier than adding another combined flag. Easier to read, anyway.

I've also fixed some other minor things, e.g. 'Edward' was shortened to
'Ed' in the WyrmKeep version. Of course, there may be regressions. And
there are some cases where English texts could appear in German versions,
but I don't know if it ever happens for any existing versin of the game.

151 is supposed to play the 'hate' speech, so eventually that wouldn't have
to be hard-coded in the intro, but at the moment all it does it to switch
to scene 152. I'd have to study the scripts closer to figure out what's
missing.

So, to summarize, there are no user-visible changes to the intro but we may
have a better test case for IHNM scripting. Maybe.

that the instruction wasn't fully read, so the next opcode would be wrong.
This is what caused it to crash.

To keep the game from hanging, I also allowed the engine to call the
_actors->direct() function for IHNM. This allows AM's intro speech to be
played in its entirety.

Since this includes the 'hate' speech, I've removed that part from the
hard-coded intro. To get the right music playing, I've enabled the
sfPlayMusic() function for IHNM. This is pure guesswork, though. Once the
scene changes, the wrong music plays again. However, this is scene music,
i.e. not scripted.

It doesn't play the background sound. Looks like _fxTable[] isn't generated
for IHNM. More noticeably, until the scene changes it doesn't show any
graphics apart from the subtitles, which are drawn in the wrong colour and
(I believe) the wrong font.

is supposed to play at this point has resource number 32. _songTable[0]
contains the value 32 at this point, so song 0 is probably a valid music
request, and not a request to stop the music.

At the other end of the list, I believe the song number has to be *less*
than _songTableLen, not less or equal to it.

But feel free to revert this change if I'm messing things up.

fixed script_c64.cpp. So there could be mistakes, though I doublechecked it.

More noticeably, we have no way of cancelling outstanding animation events,
so unless the animations finish on their own - as some of them do - the
events will just pile up, causing the animations to run faster and faster.

plays fine now, as far as I can tell, except for some missing sound effects

* Use the script-specified text area for subtitles, if there is one.

* Fixed a word-wrapping bug that would happen if a new line began with a
space. I don't know about ITE, but IHNM puts two spaces after periods. Of
course, the case where I saw this happen will probably go away once we
start using the right font, but it could still happen elsewhere.

only the SAGA engine does that, so if it still breaks it only breaks SAGA.

ite and ihnm respectively. Sorry, but I had to do it before release, no
autoupgrade as games weren't supported only in developer's version.

Fix bug #1297365 'ITE: Game detection is broken'.

Now it distinguishes between DOS CD and Win CD, though it uses platform and
language settings from .ini to do the choice. I.e current games need to be
redetected. Though only these 2 games are affected. I.e. they have exactly
same resource files, just Windows release adds up external patches. These
patches cannot be added to detection as they're stored in subdirectories.

Also I resolved problem between ite-demo-win and ite-demo-linux where latter
is a superset of former. I.e. it has all files which win demo has plus one
additional. And if you try to detect Linux demo it shows you both. Of course
this could be handled by upper solution, but to make sure I count number of
required files for matched versions and remove those which do not have max
number of files. I.e. if 2 games matched and one requires 4 and another one
requires 5 files, then we have 5 files matched which certainly points to
second game not the first.

more or less serious bugs here:

* The fnResetGlobals() function returned IR_CONT. Since it potentially
kills its own script resource, this can lead to illegal read accesses.
Not it returns IR_STOP instead. This was probably a bug in the original
interpreter as well, but it handled memory allocation quite differently
so it was probably never an issue.

* Since fnResetGlobals() forcibly closes resources, I've changed the
closeResource() function to silently ignore requests to close resources
where the data pointer is NULL. While it could signify an error, it isn't
necessarily so.

* Don't force the screen to fade up after the credits -- let the script do
it instead. This prevents it from fading up the wrong image.
