It doesn't seem very useful to keep this around for future uses,
either, at least I couldn't think of a convincing argument.
If we really need something like this one day again, it is trivial
enough to add it back.

This includes a FIXME, since _snprintf behaves differently to snprintf.
Not only in the return value (which is a minor difference, since we usually
do not use it), but also since it does not always include a terminating null.

This should assure vsnprintf and snprintf will now also always null

Currently the functions are placed in scummsys.h, but that causes us
to include two standard C library headers there (for MSVC at least).
This is not particulary nice, so we should think of a better solution
here.
