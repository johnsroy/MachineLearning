effect happened during a line of speech there was a chance - not a
certainty - that the speech would get cut off prematurely.

As far as I can tell, this is because the Vorbis decoder isn't the only one
who's accessing the same file. Now the Vorbis decoder will explicitly seek
to the position where it expects the file to be at before reading from it.
I hope this is the correct fix. It does fix the problem for me, at least.

I don't know if any of the other decoders needs a similar patch. I couldn't
reproduce the problem with my MP3-encoded FotAQ, but there are other
possible explanations for that, e.g. the bug gets harder to trigger the
more sound data that is decoded in each pass.

One of the changes, I'm not quite sure about: buildDisplay() used to open
and close the _thisScreen.background_layer_id resource for each layer it
processed. In particular, it used to 'release the screen resource before
cacheing the sprites'.

I have no idea why, because I can't see any trace of a sprite cache, and I
can't think of any harm in keeping the resource open during the whole
render cycle. The resource is probably loaded into memory already anyway,
though its reference counter may be 0.

previous one.

Animations on objects/persons setup by cutaways can still be played after the end of the cutscene. (the only ?) one room in which this is reproducable is the first time you talk to the Oracle (first c44, then c47).

our other engines do this, so there is little reason for BS2 to. I did add
a filtering mechanism so that mouse button releases and scroll wheeling is
ignored during normal gameplay, but I don't know if that was necessary
either.

Since this left little more than an empty husk where the Input class used
to be, I've eliminated that class and buried its remains in Sword2Engine.

* Draw a blinking cursor when typing savegame names. (Bug #908679)

* Number the savegame slots. At the moment they are numbered differently
than in BS2 in that they start on 1 instead of 0. As far as I recall,
this was the case with the original engine as well, but we may want to
reconsider.

* Added scroll wheel support. This wasn't in the original, but it's a nice
thing to have. Particularly since the scroll buttons don't repeat. (It
would be nice if they did.)

I would like this patch to be considered for 0.6.1, if there aren't any
obvious problems with it.

by accident, and could cause bad noises during music cross-fades.

This wasn't a problem in 0.6.0 since all music is sampled at 22050 Hz,
which is the most likely output sample rate for ScummVM, so the converter
didn't actually have to do anything. Now, however, the output sample rate
could be anything.

I've given the music streams one converter each. In BS1, which uses similar
music code, it was already necessary to do this since some of its music is
sampled at 11025 Hz.

this once. :-)

The parameters to drawLine() aren't clipped to the screen size, which meant
that it was accessing memory out of bounds when marking the screen as
dirty. The function now uses plotPoint(), which does the bounds checking
and screen dirtying for us. Apart from being a little easier to read, it
dirties only the parts of the screen the line actually passes through,
instead of a rectangle defined by the line's end points.

Since drawLine() is only used for debugging, I wouldn't consider this a
particularly serious bug.

Next change is that only the pixels inside the original parallax layer are
considered when creating the block surfaces. This may make the drawing
slightly more efficient, since fewer surfaces will be labelled as
transparent.

Plus some other minor cleanups.

should have exptected it to be the final, working version, right? Right.

became in somewhat Pascal fashion, i.e. array[2..3][10..20]. So I had to
override ArrayHeader function in ScummEngine_v72he.

Also there is new array type kDwordArray. So that is implemented as well.

Though, not everything yet transferred to use new ArrayHeader, so running
HE 7.2 titles is risky now.

Some opcodes were implemented along the way.

command, would close the global script variables and player object
resources, without reopening them again. This made them fair game for the
resource expiration mechanism. The player object is probably referenced
often enough to stay alive, but the variables died on me pretty quickly,
causing ScummVM to crash.

I've also added a 'reslist' debug command to make this sort of things
easier to spot. By default it only lists resources with refCount > 0. Use
'reslist 0' to see all the cached resources as well.

* The frame pointer is updated. This won't make any difference since we
don't actually *use* the frame pointer yet.
* Return values from script functions are handled like in the original now,
i.e. the function sets thread->retVal and lets the call instruction push
it onto the stack. (There are two call instructions, one that handles
return values and one that doesn't, so the script function doesn't know
if it should push or not.)
* Script return values are handled.

None of this makes any noticeable difference to the ITE intro.

o mt32.cpp went to backends/midi

* don't complain about File class wrapper :)
* all custom types are back

* maybe some indentation is wrong too

- Channels now ignore effectLevel() and chorusLevel(), instead of sending unsupported control change messages to MT32Emu (they're not supported in a real MT-32, either, according to docs).
- Implemented setPitchBendRange() by sending a sysex write command to adjust the patch.
- _outputRate is now hard-coded at 32000, until tuning can be fixed for other sample rates.

MT32EMu:
- Extended File interface to deal with reading/writing 16/32-bit values endian-independently (they're always big-endian on file).
- Improved usage of packing-related pragmas.
- Should now be endian-agnostic (without depending on #defines for the endianness).

I'm also not sure if I'm using the correct music data. I'm fairly sure that
the MUSICGM.RES file is the appropriate choice for 'General MIDI', but I
have no way of verifying that the MUSICFM.RES is really the right choice
for MT-32. (Is either of them a good choice for Adlib, or are they both
equally bad?)

files through the MIDI synth on my Soundblaster, I can only conclude that
they are both General MIDI, so I've changed our code to assume that in both
cases. The End Title (which we currently incorrectly play at the end of the
intro) sounds much better in Adlib this way, too.

Perhaps the original used a different GM to FM mapping than the one in our
adlib.cpp, but if so using the MT-32 to GM mapping isn't likely to improve
the situation.

We could add a way of replacing the GM to FM mapping in adlib.cpp, I guess.
Of course, that would only be worth it if the original sounds better than
our mapping.

The 'old Adlib' property was set too late in the iMUSE player, so the Adlib
driver would always think the game was new. I've removed this property from
the iMUSE player, since it's only function appeared to be to pass it on to
the Adlib player, and now set it in the Adlib player directly instead.

Also removed some remaining 'multi MIDI' traces from the iMUSE player that
I believe were obsoleted by the aforementioned 'multi MIDI' change.

console.

Some things are likely to have broken. For instance, I believe the old
console was could be visible during gameplay, while ScummVM's is modal. So
any place where we output something to the console during gameplay should
probably be removed.

Some things I've stubbed out. Basically any code that registers a variable.

Most of the debugging commands are untested.

Syntax may have changed because of different command-line parsing. (I never
actually used the old console, so I don't know for sure. :-)

Actually, I'm not that interested in reproducing the old console commands
faithfully. What we should do now is to make the immediately useful console
stuff work. Anything that remains unimplemented should probably be removed.
