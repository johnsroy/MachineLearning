done.

I don't really like this, but I can't think of any better way. It
seems that Lua doesn't like decimal comma at all, so we have to
format the volume settings with a decimal point instead. Otherwise,
all I'll ever get is either full volume or no volume, with nothing
in between.

In cases where the script failed to delete a certain character from the party (because that character was not a party member) it would add this character to the party instead. E.g. when returning to Gladstone without having picked up Timothy, he would get added to the party after the throne room scene. The same happened with Lora at the Draracle if she wasn't picked up on the way.

- endptr needs not be initialised before calling strtol(), it is always set by strtol().
- endptr is never a null pointer after calling strtol().
- There is no need to rely on strtol() setting EINVAL (which is not guaranteed).
Testing whether strtol() parsed till the end of the string is sufficient (it is guaranteed that the string is not empty at this point).
- It is sufficient to just test for ERANGE without inspecting the return value, because a successful call to strtol() does not change errno.

in bfb0986c to use ByteArray, this now causes an assertion due to
the stricter bounds checking.

This commit corrects the original issue.

Wrapping 'namespace Common {}' around the macro assignment causes clang
to complain about a spurious semicolon, and removing the semicolon at

Changing the requirement of using the macro in one namespace (the
global) to another (Common) seems a small price to pay to

'VirtScreen *' (a subclass of Surface) was passed instead of 'VirtScreen &'

Now SaveStateDescriptor no longer subclasses HashMap. Instead all possible

This is slightly less flexible, but we never needed that flexibility so far.
On the other hand it should reduce the memory usage. At least on my system
(Linux/amd64) the old SaveStateDescriptor had a size of 928 and the new
SaveStateDescriptor has a size of 200.

Speaker output.

This might affect other outputs too! And could cause regressions in case other
outputs implemented priority settings differently.

Formerly we tried to play back a ROL resource on AdLib in this case, since the
game does not contain a ADL resource for the sound the game tries to play here.
The original does not exhibit this behavior, thus I changed it to behave the
same now.

Big thanks to eriktorbjorn for noticing and finding the cause of this problem.
Also thanks to Kirben for checking how the original behaved and _athrxx for
checking the FM-Towns version of Indy4.

* Include directory nodes in FSList sent to detectGames
- This is required for correct detection of toon.
* Don't add / at the end of directories found in getChildren
- It looks like that behaviour was removed from posix-fs a long
time ago, and now there's apparently code depending on directories
_not_ having a / at the end of their name...
* Treat games detected in subdirs as duplicates
- This is a workaround for a detection bug in toon; it will incorrectly
detect the game in the MISC subdirectory as well.
* Don't avoid directories called 'install' in the game selector
- I don't know if the original reason for ignoring 'install' is still
valid, but the code for doing do so was broken anyway.

- Changed the order of the Putt-Putt games to be match the order
of the original releases by year
- Mentioned the German version of Dragon History in the paragraph
of the game
- Changed a note about Swampy Adventures in the 'Known Problems'
section of Simon the Sorcerer's Puzzle Pack: Displaying texts
when clicking on items is supported now (quick and dirty),
displaying names of items when hovering with the mouse cursor
over them is still unsupported
- Changed text that could be misunderstood in Command Line Options
section: 'Select language' to 'Select game's language'
- The lanugage of the Simon the Sorcerer games is now pre-selected
and does not allow to change it, nor to use fan patches not
mentioned in the detection tables, thus the games and all
references to them are no removed from the Language Options section
- Corrected hot keys of Simon the Sorcerer 1+2: Clearified that
't' and 'v' buttons only work in talkies of Simon 1 other than
English and German and mentioned combined speech and text mode
- Corrected function of 't' key in The Feeble Files

I suspect this is the format for AGI V1 sound resources as well. It is
currently implemented by splitting getNextNote() to getNextNote_v2() and
getNextNote_v1(). Since the V1 format consists of simple register values
to the sound chip in PCjr, this could probably be made more cleanly by
refactoring the code to resemble the chip more closely, so that its state
is updated by writing to the registers.

be found in the original README. I removed this since the English README won't
be installed anymore if the user selects German as language in the Windows

I also removed some English text that was translated in brackets and replaced
it by the translation only since the German localisation now includes this

CD1.ITK is the one CD archive file the Urban Runner scripts open
themselves in NO_CD mode. Since the PSP has extremely limited file
handles, having that archive opened twice makes the load code fail
on that device.

Hopefully, the scripts don't decide to close and not reopend CD1.ITK
in places where it's needed. A full playthrough with loading/saving
between screens (especially across CD content borders, and during
death screens) would probably be prudent.

SCI scripts can send stale pointers to kernel functions (e.g. after
loading a saved game). This is normal in some cases (such as kDisplay
and kGraphRestoreBox), and their signatures are set to allow invalid
pointers.
Thus, in such cases, allow invalid pointers, as the kernel functions
will handle them themselves. Fixes bug #3412002, and properly fixes bugs
#3389579, #3292251, #3308087 and #3056811. Removed a relevant TODO.

outfitted. This commit also marks full compatibility with the
HP TouchPad, or any future tablet device without a hardware
keyboard.

Controls:
- Left click: Single-tap once
- Right click: Put one finger on screen, single-tap another
- Middle click: Put two fingers on screen, single-tap another
- Menu: Swipe two fingers down
- Show keyboard: Swipe two fingers up
- Touchpad Mode:
- Swipe two fingers to the right to toggle
- When off (default) mouse will move to the location tapped
- When on, mouse will move relative to its current position

A regression from commit 18b48c7. The name of the normal Donna actor is
'donna', whereas it's 'donnatras' for the disguised one, so strstr()
seems to be wrong here. This fixes the bug and it shouldn't cause any
further regressions. Also, changed the relevant code to conform to our
code convention guidelines - it's quite a bad idea to not enclose a
whole big code block in brackets, as it becomes hard to read.

* Note: This really should be cleaned up and all backends that have a custom loadGFXMode() really should setup their own _videoMode.hardware* settings. Assuming the overlay will always match the hardware is flawed logic on devices with fixed hardware screens.
* Just done for the GPH backend for now to cut down on the regresion risk to other backends near the 1.4.0 release cycle.

This reimplement getSystemLanguage() for MacOS X because
setlocale() only works if the application is started from the terminal.
Instead we use CFBundleCopyPreferredLocalizationsFromArray() which
requires the translations to be listed in the bundle plist file (this had
already been committed). This fixes bug #3394080.
