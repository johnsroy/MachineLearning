Also add a table for Apple IIgs games for music issues like in PQ1
intro, where the developers thought that loading a new room would
take X amount of time and they started loading before the music was
done. In our AGI music may get cut off because of this.

It of course also happens, when using the original interpreter,
as soon as you emulate a faster processor. Which means this
is also a workaround.

We don't support playing videos with multiple edits backwards. Taking the code
path to move to the next edit when playing backwards sets the current edit index
to an invalid value with the video still trying to play. Which results in out of
bounds reads, and ultimately a crash.

This fixes multiple crashes in Myst. Using the key without the chest on
Stoneship, resetting the clock tower puzzle, and using the switch in the trees
in Channelwood.

This was a regression introduced in a59f5db505ffce9567c3bc8adf30d2f843910d65.

Bug is: 'IRIX: X BadMatch when trying to start any 640x480 game'.

40e019efd45a02261a7dbc69ceaa9188d8c7a269 introduced resetting the pixel depth
when unloading modes for SDL output. This was required to make mode listing
for OpenGL work on Win8+.

This causes issues on non-Win32 platforms though. SDL might not give us a valid
a pixel depth, causing the resetting to fail. A particular example is X11 on
IRIX, when only 16bit output modes work. Initially SDL tells us that the pixel
depth is 32bit. Trying to set this up causes a crash though.

Since there is no way to validate SDL's return value, we simply limit the reset
to platforms where it is actually required, i.e. Win32.

- Add 'kAnimate fast cast state' to 'version' debug command
- Make it possible for script patcher signatures to get fully
used outside of the regular script patcher
- Remove previous fastcast detections and replace them with
a signature heuristic
- Remove object name checking, when fastcast global is set
- Heuristic detects 'fast cast' support incorrectly for multilingual
KQ5, but it seems the game never sets the global, so it won't
matter. KQ5 CD (also SCI1 late) has fastcast support.
- Remove hack in GfxView::draw
- Add lots of comments to ScriptPatcher class

This fixes EcoQuest 1 Floppy showing the anemone on top of the

This first of all combines both detection entries and makes it
possible so that the user can directly choose English or Japanese
without having to add the game twice.
But it also fixes the in-game option to switch between English
and Japanese. Prior to this commit it was only possible to for
example switch from Japanese to English once, but it was not
possible to switch back without quitting the game and starting it

Original AGI Hercules rendering was restricted by the Hercules
resolution, which is why they had to remove the AGI prompt and
replace it with a prompt window like the one used in SCI.
We are not and even when we support that prompt window, we
will still support the original AGI prompt even for Hercules
rendering.
Maybe some games had special graphic code, when Hercules rendering
is active. This needs to get checked.

We are now telling the scripts that we are running on EGA,
so that they don't put text at different coordinates.
Hercules rendering also used a different grid for putting text
for example Space Quest 2 right at the start.
This change avoids problems with such placement. We don't really
want to restrict ourselves by implementing that different
text grid resolution.

Also added comments on game feature flags.

This implementation is not 100% engine accurate, but it is
more accurate than what was there, and hopefully the differences
between this and the engine code are merely cosmetic.

The known (intentional) differences are:

1. Uses ScummVM rects inside the engine code, converting to/from
SCI rects on the kernel edges and when scaling
2. Fewer side effects when performing operations that *should*
have been pure from the start (like text dimension calculation).
Still not side-effect-free, but at least things like colours
and alignment do not need to be reset every time a measurement
is taken, unlike in the actual engine.

Editor controls and some other kBitmap code are temporarily
disabled as a result of changes to GfxText32 until they can be
updated to be engine-accurate.

these transitions to ~30fps, which hopefully roughly matches
the speed of the engine on hardware of the era.

(Look https://sourceforge.net/p/scummvm/bugs/6980/)

The warning messages were appearing because when PRECACHE_RESOURCES is
not defined, ResourceManager's `requestResource()` was used to manually
'cache' them. When you do that, ResourceManager 'locks' the resource
once, so you must `release()` it later.

Resources were not released, and warnings appeared. When you
`release()` resource, it still is loaded ('cached'). Resource's
`getLockCount()` is 0, though, so it might be unloaded by
ResourceManager if there is a lot of resources.

When selecting non-English language, the scripts default to using
German voices. This commit edits the file path on the fly to use instead
English voices for all languages other than German. This implements bug
#6804 - SWORD25: add option to choose language speech.

If the English voice pack is not present it falls back to using German voices.

The way this is implemented here however does not allow to use German
voices with English text or English voices with German text. This could be
achieved with a slightly different implementation of the same idea.

create a GLES 1.1 context one would need to link against libGL.so. However,

For compatibility location 0 is used to decide whether fixed function style

assign the color information to be passed through attribute 0. This caused
the array attribute status for location 0 to be disabled and resulted in
wrong vertex data to be used.

This was part regression (ManagedSurface is picky about the order
of the parameters to the line drawing functions), part bug since
it was drawing a horizontal line instead of a vertical.

This call draws a very short vertical line to separate the
rightmost 'join' of the middle horizontal bar in the inventory
dialog from the scrollbar. Unless you know what you're looking
for, it's pretty hard to spot the difference.

Thanks to dreammaster for figuring out the proper fix, while I
was still trying to figure out what it was trying to draw.

This fix applies to drawPanelText(), where we used to hard-code
the text positions. Now we define the dimensions of the area where
the text is drawn (like we do for button texts) and calculate the
position based on the dimensions of the text string.

The drawPanelText() function is used for the Save, Quit, Protect
and Option dialogs, but for everything except the Option dialog it
already centered the text to the dialog. I decided to use this
centering mechanism for the title of the ITE Option dialog, even
though that changes the X coordinate by one pixel. Other than that,
it only affects the following texts:

ITE:  Show Dialog / Reading Speed, Music and Sound
IHNM: Reading Speed, Music, Sound, Voices

I have verified that this looks at least ok for the English and
German versions of ITE, and the English, German, French and
Spanish versions of IHNM, so I'm reasonably confident that this
change is ok.

Keep track of where a mouse press started when deciding how mouse-over
and mouse-up should behave.

This handles the following situations:

1) If a mouse press starts outside a button (e.g. the UI background),
mouse-up inside the button has no effect. Previously, it triggered a
button click.
2) If a mouse press starts inside a button, the cursor moves outside of
its region, then back inside, the button will show as pressed.
Previously, it showed as highlighted instead of pressed.

This in particular fixes bug #7111: Incorrect position in texts, not as the

DosBox, so the result is not identical.

This change is based on the code before the commit 7cf7f4b
'Rewrote the very confusing centerText() function into something that
makes more sense'. The changes in that commit do not all make
sense to me so I reverted the line spacing (to add back 2 pixels between
text lines) and part of the logic to center text. The result looks a lot
closer to the original engine in DosBox, but not identical.

This was a regression from commit fa3d3e3 and this fixes part of
bug #7113 DRASCULA: Serious sprite glitches.

The original uses extraSurface to draw text in draw_abc() in the
Spanish version while other languages use tableSurface. But in
ScummVM this was changed to use tableSurface for all languages.
However this caused an issue in chapter 6 when displaying the
inventory has it is also using tableSurface, as it was for all languages
in the original. While using the same surface works for other
languages, in the Spanish version we get the wrong background in
the inventory.

Rather than revert to using extraSurface for drawing text which is
a big change and impact all the chapters, I have opted to simply
swap the usage of the tableSurface and extraSurface in chapter 6
for the Spanish version compared to the original engine. The
changes therefore only impact chapter 6 and only the Spanish
version. I played the chapter in full to check that it indeed works
without causing adverse effects.

So explicitly hide it at the start of this specific animation (and it gets
shown again when we enter room 102 at the end of the animation).

To time animations the original engine uses interrupt to get the
Real Time Clock and divides the number of clock ticks by 0.182.
Since there is approximately 18.2 ticks per second, this means
it uses values in 1/100th of a second. In ScummVM we were using
getMillis() / 20, so the animations was two times slower than in
the original.

This might fix bug #7115 Drascula: FPS are incorrect or some
frames are dropped.

Note that for the walk animation we are still not exactly using the
timing of the original. The original engines keeps each walk frames
for 5.7 times 1/100th of a second (i.e. 17.54 FPS). In ScummVM
getTime returns an integer value and as a result each walk frame is
now kept for 6 times 1/100th of a second (i.e. 16.67 FPS, which i
better than the 8.33 FPS we were getting before this commit).

as our getTime returns integer values and thus we use
frames for 6 of 1/100th of a second while the original is slightly
faster as it kept frames for 5.7 times 1/100th of a second.

was most noticeable with Spanish speech but also occurred

The delay, since it updates the mouse position, resulted in a
different verb being selected than the one we clicked on when
moving the mouse quickly after the clic. This was quite confusing
and frustrating. I can't see any reason for this delay and it seems
to work well without it. The initial commit adding it indicates this
was 'for better mouse response', but it added a lot of other delays
at the same time, and removing this one doesn't see to impact the
mouse response (on the contrary, we get the new cursor quicker).

right mouse click on game

Also move a delay when left clicking to after performing the action.
With the delay between the left click and the action, the mouse
position could have moved when performing the action, resulting
in the wrong action being performed (e.g. activating the wrong verb
or picking the wrong object in the inventory). But removing the
delay altogether causes flickering when picking objects from the
inventory.

This reverts commit 9909cc615d527bc8d43f930d8c88dc014974f2de.

This will likely cause invalid memory reads because it frees the last output
buffer which is used to keep files in memory. There is a possible memory leak
here, when the input data is not well formed. However, fixing this takes some
more effort than the solution in the reverted commit.

Most SCI32 games draw a 'fred' object to the screen when the game
first starts to benchmark video performance. When framerate
throttling is enabled (which fixes many/most timing-related bugs
and reduces system load caused by unnecessary graphics updates),
the game's performance check will think that video card is slow,
causing some 'high-performance' game features to be disabled.

To avoid this, we simply disable throttling during benchmarking by
detecting the 'fred' object.

Digital audio calls shunted through kDoSound have also been
updated to go through the SCI32 audio mixer, though these shunts
are a bit hacky because the ScummVM implementation of kDoSound
does not currently match how SSCI kDoSound is designed.

It is probably possible in the future to just replace the SCI1.1
audio code (audio.cpp) with the new SCI32 code, since the major
differences seem to be that (1) SCI1.1 only supported one digital
audio playback channel (this is configurable already), (2) it
had extra commands for CD audio playback and queued sample
playback.

Using the one from SCI2.1mid makes fades very slow because SDL has
a larger audio buffer than SSCI DOS. This new algorithm is based on
wall time so will always fade at the correct speed, although the
larger buffers will have a coarser granularity so the fades may
not be as smooth as in the original engine. If anyone cares, the
fade volume could be mixed into individual samples in `readBuffer`
instead of applying just once per complete buffer. SSCI did not
do this, however, so this implementation should be pretty accurate.

The way dimensions of scaled screen items are calculated changed

in later games (like Torin), local scaling of individual screen
items seems to be the way scaling is performed.

In SSCI, VMD is drawn by a standard CelObjMem wrapped by a
ScreenItem, giving the location of the bitmap memory to the
decoder. The decoder already supports this, but the API was
previously hidden behind the AdvancedVMDDecoder wrapper
(which is more convenient to use than the VMDDecoder class).

Several functions in Audio32 would call into the mixer to pause
or resume the audio handle, which would cause a deadlock if the
mixer's mixCallback timer fired while one of these functions was
running on the main thread.

To address this, calls to mixer to pause/unpause the digital audio
handle have been removed. Since this was just an optimisation to
prevent unnecessary calls to fill the audio buffer, the only
problem now is that a tiny amount of CPU is wasted on unnecessary
callbacks to read from the empty SCI mixer.
