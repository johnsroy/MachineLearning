(Look https://sourceforge.net/p/scummvm/bugs/6980/)

The warning messages were appearing because when PRECACHE_RESOURCES is
not defined, ResourceManager's `requestResource()` was used to manually
'cache' them. When you do that, ResourceManager 'locks' the resource
once, so you must `release()` it later.

Resources were not released, and warnings appeared. When you
`release()` resource, it still is loaded ('cached'). Resource's
`getLockCount()` is 0, though, so it might be unloaded by
ResourceManager if there is a lot of resources.

When selecting non-English language, the scripts default to using
German voices. This commit edits the file path on the fly to use instead
English voices for all languages other than German. This implements bug
#6804 - SWORD25: add option to choose language speech.

If the English voice pack is not present it falls back to using German voices.

The way this is implemented here however does not allow to use German
voices with English text or English voices with German text. This could be
achieved with a slightly different implementation of the same idea.

This was a regression from commit fa3d3e3 and this fixes part of

The original uses extraSurface to draw text in draw_abc() in the
Spanish version while other languages use tableSurface. But in
ScummVM this was changed to use tableSurface for all languages.
However this caused an issue in chapter 6 when displaying the
inventory has it is also using tableSurface, as it was for all languages
in the original. While using the same surface works for other
languages, in the Spanish version we get the wrong background in
the inventory.

Rather than revert to using extraSurface for drawing text which is
a big change and impact all the chapters, I have opted to simply
swap the usage of the tableSurface and extraSurface in chapter 6
for the Spanish version compared to the original engine. The
changes therefore only impact chapter 6 and only the Spanish
version. I played the chapter in full to check that it indeed works
without causing adverse effects.

To time animations the original engine uses interrupt to get the

Since there is approximately 18.2 ticks per second, this means

getMillis() / 20, so the animations was two times slower than in
the original.

This might fix bug #7115 Drascula: FPS are incorrect or some
frames are dropped.

Note that for the walk animation we are still not exactly using the
timing of the original. The original engines keeps each walk frames
for 5.7 times 1/100th of a second (i.e. 17.54 FPS). In ScummVM
getTime returns an integer value and as a result each walk frame is
now kept for 6 times 1/100th of a second (i.e. 16.67 FPS, which i
better than the 8.33 FPS we were getting before this commit).
