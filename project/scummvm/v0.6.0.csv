Corrected a problem with resource size computation for GMF sound
effect resources. Since GMF resources have no size info, we were
computing sizes with the assumption that each GMF appears in its
own file, so the file size becomes the resource size. This is true
for simon1dos music files but not for SFX files. This fix uses the
resource offset pointers at the beginning of SFX files to properly
compute the size of SFX resources.

Tweaked handling of ImSetTrigger when the triggered
command starts a new song. If the song to be started
is already playing, we stop it (in preparation for
a restart) ONLY if the song containing the command
trigger is actually playing. Otherwise the restart
is likely to never occur (as is the case with the
Bumpusville mansion interior music).

V6 scripts can specify up to 16 parameters to be passed to
doCommand(). In most cases 8 or fewer parameters were used,
but occasional uses of 9 or 10 parameters resulted in
incorrect iMuse behavior due to lost doCommand() data.

ImTrigger was also upgraded to support 8 parameters instead
of 4, since the incorrect behavior that was observed involved
the use of triggered commands that required more than 4
parameters. Since ImTrigger data is not currently being saved
(which is bad), we do not at this time have to go to another
savegame format to support the additional ImTrigger data
(which is good).

This fix corrects a problem in the Tunnel of Love. When the
'execution scene' music finishes and the hidden door opens,
the Tunnel of Love music is supposed to start up again. In
ScummVM, it never would, do to the loss of parameters for a
trigger-based 'Parameter Fade' command.

A bit of miscellaneous cleanup has also been made.

imuse multimidi on/off - Set multimidi
imuse play # - Play a sound resource

imuse stop # - Stop a music resource
imuse stop all - Stop all music resources

Note that 'play #' and 'play random' only attempt

a music resource or is in a format not supported by
the current music driver, it won't play.

You can use this as a mini jukebox, but be sure

goal is to minimize interference from the scripts
while playing sounds that are not expected in

Checked for OOB channel clear command. The 'travel' music
in question seems to try to clear channel 4 when there are
only channels 0-3. Now we check and bail if OOB.

Perhaps this isn't quite the correct thing to do. Would
channel 4 be significant, as in perhaps 'clear ALL channels'?

switch to -enull so that music resources still get parsed

for the making it a timer handler. This should eliminate the occasional
glitches I've been seeing with fades not being completed.

I'm also hoping that it will fix the problem where the game would sometimes
hang when moving between rooms. I know that at least once when I had that
happen to me the game was busy-waiting for the palette to fade.

At the very least, it's one place less to worry about thread-safety in.

sprites are drawn, but I think that's how it should be.

1: No bells or whistles.
2: This setting adds sprite blending, e.g. the smoke at the docks or the
display cases at the Glease Gallery.
3: This setting adds light map support, e.g. when walking under the shack
at the docks.
4: This setting adds better scaling algorithms.

The first three settings should work fine now. In fact, the third setting
is what we used to implement. The fourth setting still needs work and
testing. I've added code for downscaling case, but frankly I'm not
convinced the result is any better than with the simpler scaler. I usually
can't even tell the difference.

Of course, my translation of the original code could very well be buggy.

block surfaces. (A block surface is a 64x64 tile of a parallax layer.)

I've also done a few things to try and optimize the drawing:

* The back buffer is no longer cleared between frames. This may cause
regressions, but I do believe that the entire picture area is always
completely re-rendered for each frame.

As a result of this, the menu code is now responsible for clearing the
icon areas itself.

* A few unnecessary copy_rect() calls were commented out in favor of one
big copy_rect() in ServiceWindows().

* Completely opaque block surfaces are copied with memcpy(), one line at a
time.

Unless we manage to add intelligent screen redrawing, I don't think it will
get that much faster than this, though there is some unnecessary data
copying in DrawSprite() that could be removed.

And the game is still a terrible CPU hog. I believe the animation runs at
approximately 12 fps. If there's still time left, it will pump out further
frames to get smooth scrolling. We ought to put a cap on that, and if it
has already reached the scroll target it should sleep for the rest of the
render cycle.

fast enough to test that.

Two other bugs fixed in the process:

displayed. If so, that should be fixed now.

* I discovered that there are cases where we do need to clear the screen

Implemented _cmd_queue save/load. In addition to requiring
_cmd_queue information, this bug arises from a rare assumption
that sound resources are loaded in memory even though they
aren't currently playing. Therefore, a list of sound resources
loaded in memory is included in the savegame, so that all
relevant sound resources are reloaded when the savegame is
loaded. This also fixes an unreported music bug in S&M when
saving a game while outside the Bumpusville mansion.

As a result of savegame format modifications, we are now at
savegame version 23.

Implemented a parser for Euphony music. No
FM instrument support yet, as the FM chip used
by FM Towns is not being emulated yet. In the
meantime, a stock FM-emulated GM instrument is
being used instead.

This at least makes the Zak Towns kazoo tune
and the Loom Towns distaff audible. Emulation
of the FM Towns synth chip, or suitable
emulation using the OPL2 synth, is still
under investigation.

This pretty much concludes the first stage of the engine cleanup. All of
the files, except for console/debugging stuff and possibly some header
files, have been changed to use the ScummVM brace style.

As for the console, that one could probably do with some rewriting, in
which case cleaning it up first would just be unnecessary work.

The next stages of the cleanup should include renaming of variables and
functions to follow the ScummVM coding standards, and turning everything
into C++ classes. And so on.

Of course, the driver directory should go through a similar cleanup as
well.

This has all been enormously tedious, so don't count on me doing any of
these things at the moment. Particularly not turning everything into C++
classes. I'm really not that familiar with C++. :-)

equally for all channels, to ensure that entire
notes don't get cut off. The patch as committed is
slightly modified to reorder the MT-32 initialization
sequence. The mods (1) ensure a brief delay between
SysEx transmissions to give the MT-32 time to process
each request, and (2) hopefully sequence the delays
such that the ScummVM welcome message is actually
readable and doesn't just flash for a split-second
(as was the reported behavior in the past).

console from the SCUMM engine. I decided that would be easier than to clean
up the original console code.

Unfortunately there's a bunch of code that I just copied - a pretty lousy
form of code-reusal. It'd be nice if the console could be made part of the
Engine class, or something like that.

Most of the debug commands seem to be working. Some aren't relevant for
ScummVM, and some are a bit obscure so I'm not quite sure what they're
supposed to be doing.

etc. to the different opcodes. Until now it has done so by casting the
pointer to an int32 (opcode parameters are represented as arrays of int32)
and then the opcode function casts it back to whatever pointer it needs.

At least in C there is no guarantee that a pointer can be represented as an
integer type (though apparently C99 may define such a type), so this has
struck me as unsafe ever since I first noticed it.

However, since all such pointers appear to point to the memory block owned
by the memory manager, we can easily convert them to integers by treating
them as offsets into the memory block. So that's what I have done. I hope I
caught all the occurences in the opcode functions, or we're going to have
some pretty interesting regressions on our hands...

If a cluster file isn't found the resource manager will first check if it's
one of the files that it expects to find on the hard disk. If so, it's
considered a fatal error.

Otherwise it will present the user with an 'Insert CD1' or 'Insert CD2'
message, just like the original did. Unlike the original, the user will
have to press a button or click the mouse to indicate when he's done. I
don't know if we even can detect the CD automatically in any portable way.

As far as I can see, we'll need at least two separate path settings for
this to actually work: one for the HD install directory, and one or two for
the CDs. The file that are supposed to be found on the HD are only on one
of the CDs, so the amount of CD swapping would probably be unbearable
otherwise.

As a consequence, I haven't actually tried running the game from CD yet.

By the way, the old caching code has been removed completely now. All it
did was to copy the cluster file to HD for faster access. ScummVM never did
that, but so far no one has complained.

in the Mine Road sequence of Full Throttle for me.

The crashes were always in proc64(), with 'en' being some ridiculously
large value. The function, as it was written, did not make any sense to me
so I rewrote it with the assumption that it's there to remove the 'en'th
element of the _val216d[] (remaining enemies?) array.

I don't know how well it will work from proc63() if there's more than one
element to remove - at least if the elements to remove are neighbours - but
maybe that case never happens.

noticeably:

* It no longer matters where you release the mouse button when talking to
someone. It uses whatever topic you selected on mouse-down.

* The inventory menu doesn't vanish if you're holding an object, even if
you move the pointer away from it.

* When using an object on a character (to talk to him about it), the top
menu fades away, rather than vanishing instantly.

Ok, that last change is rather non-obvious, but it does obsolete the
clearMenu() function, which has therefore been removed.

volume would 'jump' when changing the fading 'direction' of a stream.

Also changed the logic for deciding which music stream to stop if both
streams are playing and a third stream is started. Before it always tried
to pick the one that was fading down. Now it will pick the one with the
lowest volume, assuming that the more faded a stream is the lower its
volume.

Together, this should fix some abrupt music changes at the watchman's hut,
where it would sometimes start two music streams in rapid succession.

I've also added some code - disabled by default - to allow the cutscenes to
run with libmpeg 0.3.1, since that's what I've got on my Linux box. It
appears to work on that one, though I only have the 'eye' cutscene on it
yet.

Ogg Vorbis playback is still broken for me under Windows, though. I wonder
if it is because I don't have the very latest Ogg Vorbis libraries on it
