- new GUI/themes

- no more funky colors!

- load/delete saved games


- cleaned-up Makefile.PS2 :
- dropped multiple extra paths
- dropped deprecated deps (UCL, MPEG2)


- all possible devices are supported to store, play and save games:

- CD
- HD
- USB
- MC
- REMOTE ! (this could actually be anywhere on the internet
as long as you run 'ps2client listen' on the machine on
the other side that hosts the games)


- tested from :
- ps2link
- uLE
- toxicOS


- tested with:
- bass
- bs1
- mi1
- comi
- indy4
- ft
- ite
- ihnm
- elvira1
- dig
- kyra
- lure
- simon2
- goblins1

Played all those games in 1 session using RTL. Very smooth,
sub-second RTL experience. No crash!


- new PAL/NTSC detection : we are now reading the flavor from PS2 ROM,
it should work on all PS2 slim too


- new PAL TV centering : no more missing chunk of games on top/bottom


- we can now read the savefiles from Linux/SDL and other backends!
if you add that you can read them from remote together with the
games that you already have there, you can imagine the fun ;-)


- we fully implement RTL with every games/engine


- we nicely reboot / shutdown on quit


- fully support for themes/savegames paths. Run from MC, play the
games on remote and store your data on USB or HD. No limits!


- universal write/read for every media (of course no write on CD/DVD!)


- fully async / DMA read-write access to every media (even MC!)


- optimized cache/read-ahead for every media - now COMI is fast and
enjoyable from remote as it is from CD ;-)


- non polluting MC storage, just 1 folder + 1 icon, so that you can
copy all your settings / saved games to another MC in one go!
