The new DBOPL emulator we are using should support multiple instances though. We *might*
consider allowing as many instances as the user wants. Of course since the original
games only had one OPL chip available, that should not be required. Also just in case
we might allow real hardware as playback device that would be out of the question again
too.

Since List::remove will remove *all* occurances of that list entry, it will
also invaldiate the reference, resulting in invalid memory reads after the
entry has been removed from the list, when List::remove will continue to
search the rest of the list for more occurances of the same entry.

The problem here was that SCUMM only uses CursorMan.replaceCursor. When no
cursor had been setup before it would cause the SCUMM cursor to be never
removed from CursorMan, since in this case replaceCursor just uses pushCursor.
To avoid this problem I am just pushing a dummy cursor (and palette, since
that is used in SCUMM HE games too) on engine setup and removing it on engine
destruction.

Actually every engine should setup their first cursor via CursorMan.pushCursor
and then on quit remove it again via CursorMan.popCursor. Using
CursorMan.replaceCursor is *no* good idea for the first cursor to setup, since
that might either replace an existing cursor, thus destroying the caller's
cursor, or pushing a new cursor on the stack, which might result in a leak.
This would also result in making a call to CursorMan.popCursor unsafe, since
that might also impact the caller's cursor setup again.

Unlike in the branch-1-1-x I did not restore the old RawMemoryStream
code in the trunk. Instead I stripped out the pre-buffering of the
RawStream code. I still decided to add some in-place buffering
in RawStream::readBuffer to at least not rely on super-fast disk I/O.

This is currently an experimental change. There might be need to
reconsider the buffering (even though backends with slow disk I/O
should actually do buffering for file I/O on their own).

Formerly the code just casted the 'ascii' value of the key event to 'byte'
and thus truncating the character value. Now that would be fine, if we
would not allow values >= 256 in the ascii field, for example 322 for F8
which in turn resulted in a 'B' added to the editable field. I just added
a check for the values being in the byte range before doing the cast,
which fixes this.

With these changes, we are a bit closer to how autoconf works, the
de-facto standard for configure scripts. The changes make it easier
for packagers to modify where ScummVM install things (e.g. the
Maemo port might benefit from this). It is now also trivial to
override certain paths when invoking make, e.g. you can now do
make install prefix=/opt
and also datadir, mandir etc. will reflect the change.

Based on patch #2903830: 'Updated Translation Prototype' by alexbevi
which in turn is based on patch #1739965 by jvprat.

Currently it builds all translations right into ScummVM. Once the
feature will be accepted more widely, i.e. more translations will
pop up, it will be trivial to move translation strings to external
file.

Finished translation: Russian
Unfinished translation: Hungarian

Things which are nice to do:
- Language code -> language mapping for more user friendness
- Specifying fonts to be used with language
- Updating of interface language without restart. It will require
moving of much code to reflowLayout() methods for each dialog

The .po files must be in single byte encodings. I.e. no support
for Unicode.

This should allow for better error handling. Also, it
means that g_sci->getResMan() returns a valid value much sooner,
allowing me to simplify some code.

Also added a note about potentially replacing Common::FSList usage
by Common::Archive (and FSNode by Archive/ArchiveMember ?). This
might be a way to unify the addAppropriateSources variants again.

The problem here is that our ConfigDialog uses '' as domain name,
this will result in the assert in common/config-manager.cpp:323
getting triggered, when using ConfMan.removeKey.

Since setting the domain to the game's domain does not seem save
according to the FIXME in gui/dialogs.cpp about this domain hackery,
I decided to adapt the OptionsDialog to only call ConfMan.removeKey
for 'music_driver' etc., when the music driver widgets are present.
This is consistent with the over uses of removeKey in
OptionsDialog::close too.

The problem here was that the code used operator[] of HashMap

but that on the other hand inserted a (key, value) pair with
a default constructed Common::String as value.

It formerly only used the global 'mt32_device' and 'gm_device'

that into account now.

Also formerly the the check for the first available MT32/GM
device only used the device handle of the mt32_device/gm_device
instead of the list of devices it iterates over. Fixed that too.

Last but not least that whole detection code looks strange to me,
it seems we only use mt32_device and gm_device for fallback
detection, at least when the music_driver matches it will always
be used. So I wonder why we have those at all?

simply iterates over both lists separately. This changes the
resulting order a bit, but since we never gave any

This is also an attempt to make the transition from the old settings to the
new ones a little less rough, by trying to put something sensible into the
first device, which is what's used by default. Currently it prefers 17:x
and 65:x since they're the old defaults, followed by 128:x since that's
probably TiMidity.

The old SCUMMVM_PORT environment variable still overrides any config
settings. I haven't made up my mind whether or not that's a good idea, but
at least it prints a warning message.

TODO: The old 'alsa_port' setting is not handled. It should probably be
used to set sensible defaults for the new settings, but I'm not sure where
this should be done.

TODO: The documentation will need to be updated, once everything is working
the way it should.

We now use a manual parser instead of a bison-generated one, and the

Also change the parse/spec tree nodes to use direct pointers to
their child nodes to make it more convenient to manipulate the trees.

This has a high potential for regressions.

It is a long standing bug which was revealed by r31784. With that commit
Kirben switched DIG code to newer one. Russian version used 0x03 as
placeholders for keeping string widths. Original did not copy those
characters but we did hence the bug. Based on study of original.

Restrict it to Dig-only in order to avoid regressions.

Formerly the MSVC 2010 project files did not respect the global include/library/executable directories of the user, but used custom paths for that. This resulted in headers and libraries not be found by the MSVC, in case they were not stored in %(SCUMMVM_LIBS).

Additionally it overwrote the executable MSVC used when compiling for x64, thus breaking the x64 target.

in our GUI code, for the time being it is feasible.

The patch was extended with way to specify tooltip background in the

Often, a client has more than one available port. Pick the first one
that isn't already in use. For instance, on my computer client 17 is
the 'Emu10k1 WaveTable', and it has four available ports. If, say,
aplaymidi is already playing on port 17:0, ScummVM will use port 17:1
instead. Otherwise the two programs will mess up each others
instruments and controller settings.

Of course, in reality I doubt that anyone will run two different MIDI

games are taken from the .ini file, but icons are still scanned for

Since I got no response to my mail to -devel, I just assume that there is
no specific reason for using rand() in SCI.

As explained in my mail to -devel about why SCI uses rand, this might allow
SCI to work with our event recording, when that ever gets finished.

I adapted kRandom so that it also supports negative random numbers. And
furthermore that the toNumber argument is smaller than the fromNumber
argument. I am not sure whether that really happens though, but it should
be safer to have this. I marked that place with an TODO/CHECKME.

- FM-Towns euphony driver completely rewritten based on KYRA FM-Towns and LOOM towns disasm.

- Split all the emu and driver code from sound_towns.cpp into different files to make things a bit less confusing.

- Move the driver code to common space since the exact same euphony driver is used by LOOM which means we could get rid of the outdated and incomplete ym2612 driver/emu implementation (which doesn't even do things like instrument loading, pan position, etc). I haven't tried to add this to the Scumm engine yet, since I am not  familiar with it and my priority was to get the driver finished first. But from the look of disasm it shouldn't be difficult to do.

- Introduce a generic FM-Towns audio interface based on FM-Towns system file disasm which was necessary for the euphony driver rewrite. Every FM-Towns game I have seen so far seems to access the audio hardware via these system functions. This interface implementation will also allow reasonably simple creation of new FM-Towns audio drivers (e.g. this could be used for Kings Quest 5 FM-Towns or others).

- Move the PC98 driver to common space, too, since I have a strong feeling that this driver is also used in the PC98 version of Future Wars

- This also improves KYRA FM-Towns music quality, sound effects accuracy and music fading.

- Start rewriting audio code for FM-TOWNS versions of Loom, Indy3 and Monkey Island 1 using the recently added code in towns_audio.cpp (Zak should work the same way, but I can't test, since I don't own that one).
- All sound types (pcm, euphony and cd audio) now support volume and balance control (e.g. try walking into/out of the kitchen and opening/closing the door in the Scumm Bar in Monkey Island 1 or walking into/out of the circus tent).
- Pcm sounds now support proper loop start/end and note offsets (e.g. try out the hammer sound in the forge in LOOM for example).
- some other minor improvements
- The FM-Towns versions of Indy 4 and Monkey Island 2 are not affected. I don't have Monkey Island 2, but I presume that it will work like Indy 4. Adding support for these will be a separate task, since they work quite differently.

finished implementing context support for the translations.

This change means there can now be different translations for the same

There is a new macro _c(msg, ctxt) that should be used instead of _(msg) in
the source code when we want to add a context to the message. For the
moment I have added contexts to only one message ('None') so that I could
test the changes. Context could be added also to get shorter translations when
GUI is in 1x mode.

I have also added back the fuzzy option to msmerge since it is useful when
adding contexts to populate the translations for the new contexts.

The TranslationManager in ScummVM will pick up the translation associated
to no context if present and if a translation could not be found for a specific
context. Based on this, the create_translations tool will now remove the
translation associated to a specific context if the same message has the
same translation associated to no context. This generate a smaller
translation.dat file, and this should also slightly improve performances (less
strings to load from the file and smaller list in which to look for a translated
message).

The problem that caused the crash in BS2 had to do with GCC making improper assumptions about our code. Specifically, the alignment trick we use for READ_UINT32/16 allows some targets(e.g. MIPS) to generate better code, but it also goes against ANSI C aliasing rules, which prohibit the sharing of addresses between a struct and another variable value. Using -fno-strict-aliasing tells GCC not to assume strict ANSI C aliasing and also unfortunately prevents it from making some good optimizations.

This change is probably needed for other platforms as well -- the crash on the PSP was simply a very rare coincidence.

This is a better solution for the gcc aliasing problem that happens when aliasing a struct onto something else. What happens is that the compiler assumes no aliasing can happen when -O2 and -O3 are activated, and a call to READ_UINT32() followed by WRITE_UINT32() and another READ_UINT32() will be optimized to return the original read value instead of re-reading.

This is currently done in the engine code. I adapted AGI, AGOS, DRACI,
GROOVIE, LURE, MADE, QUEEN, SAGA, SKY, TINSEL and TOUCHE to send a reset
device on startup. The sound output still works fine (started up a game
from every engine), so this should hopefully not introduce any regressions.

As far as I can tell it seems that SCUMM does send a proper device reset, so
I did not touch it. KYRA only sends a proper reset for MT-32 currently. I am
not sure about SCI though.

MIDI files do not setup the channel volume properly before using the channels,
but rely on having the maxed out. Since formerly the channel volume was
initialized to 255, it caused the channel volume to be zero in case the user
used 128 for his volume settings (128*255/255=128, and MIDI volume goes from
0-127).

the skycpt tool needs to be run, but this was only previously used on case-insensitive
OS i.e. Win32. To get this to work normally on case-sensitive OS i.e. Unix, a number of
corrections were made to the hardcoded filenames to ensure the same case as the
input files.

Minor corrections :
The README was also amended to deal with the pitfall of decompressing savefiles.
Added output of each RESET.* file as processed so offending file can be seen on assertion.
Corrected segfault on missing COMPACT.TXT, so exit is more graceful.

This commit should fix at least the following bugs/feature requests: #1032859, #1252088, #1055391, #1315968, #1315938, #1742106, #812891.
The FM-Towns version of Scumm games use a mixed graphics mode with 2 layers (one with 32767 colors and one with 16 colors). Among other things I have added a screen output class which emulates this  dual layer approach which allows specific hardware effects like enabling and disabling layers (e.g. in the voodoo priestess scene in MI1).

Old savegames (saved before this update) will load, but you’ll encounter palette glitches in the verb/inventory screen, since the 16 color palette for layer 2 is not contained in your savegame. This will be true at least for version 5 games. Certain scene change actions (which require the verb/inventory part to be redrawn) might correct this (e.g. try looking at the treasure map in MI1 and closing it). Version 3 games should be okay, since they use a static text palette which is never changed and which will be reset after loading a savegame.

This update requires a USE_RGB_COLORS setting for proper operation. 8 bit users will get a warning that they’ll have to expect palette glitches . Apart from that the engine in 8 bit mode should not only still work okay, but also benefit from some of the other (non palette related) improvements (e.g. bug #1032859 should be fixed even in 8 bit mode).

Japanese font drawing hasn’t been improved much yet. This will be a separate task.

Actually, currently all engines are added to the project, but not all
are activated. Enabling and disabling engines is currently not easily
possible from within the project itself. So for now I manually enabled
exactly those engines which configure enables by default.

A proper solution would be to refactor the project, with (sub)targets
resp. (sub)projects for every engine. We might also want to switch the
iPhone port to use dynamic plugins.

The return value of vsnprintf when the provided buffer is not large
enough to hold the formatted string is implementation-dependent:

C99:  The size the formatted string would take up.
MSVC: -1, with no indication of how large the buffer should be.
IRIX: The number of characters actually written, which is at most
the size of the buffer minus one, as the string is truncated
to fit.  This means the only way to be sure the entire string
is written is if the return value is less than the capacity - 1.

This change means that whenever we try to format a string where the size
is 1 below the built-in capacity, that the capacity will be needlessly increased.

If this turns out to be problematic we could make this behaviour __sgi conditional.
