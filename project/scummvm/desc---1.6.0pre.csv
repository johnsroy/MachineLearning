The hard-coded Once Upon A Time titles, Abracadabra and Baba Yaga,
are impossible to distinguish by file name alone. The same is true
for the each three platforms, DOS, Amiga and Atari ST.

We do need to know exactly which game and platform a specific path
holds, though, because they're
a) completely hard-coded
b) the data files have platform-specific endianness

Therefore, when the filename-based fallback detector finds one of
those games, we open the archives and look inside them.
We detect the specific game by looking at which animal names are
present; and the platform by inspecting the endianness of the
title screen's DEC file, in addition to the existence of a MOD
file to distinguish the Atari ST from the Amiga version.

Traced with gdb to sound.cpp:792 i.e. _fadeOutTimer infinite loop.

This bug was introduced by the addition of the MT-32 output driver for
Future Wars and associated mutex changes.
The _fadeOutTimer increment is done by the timer callback occuring
during the load method call, but this was excluded by the mutex.

Fixed by moving the mutex in the load method.

It seems the explicit destructor of ShuttleHUD is problematic. When I move
it's implementation to shuttlehud.cpp it does not segfault. Removing it on
the other hand also does not cause it to segfault. So I chose the latter,
since it has no special implementation anyway.

This bug occurs because in the cases specified in the bug report, the main
loop hasn't run fully yet, and there is a mini loop running instead (e.g.
inside Print())
Hopefully, this catches most cases where the crash occurs, but it needs more
testing to find if there is any other such case.

how accurate it is, particularly in tempo and volume, but at this

off, but it was before as well.

There is an annoying drawn out note in the music when you're following

well.

In looped music, prevent the music channels from drifting out of
sync over time. This was noticeable after a few minutes in the
SCUMM Bar. We do this by extending the last note (which is just
zeroes, so we didn't even use to play it) so that it has the
exact number of samples needed to make all channels the exact
same length. (This is calculated when the music is loaded, so it
does not need any extra data in the save games, thankfully.)

As a result, the getNextNote() is now responsible for converting
the duration to number of samples (out of necessity) and for
converting the note to a pitch modifier (out of symmetry). I made
several false starts before I realized how much easier it would
be this way.

After listening to the original music in a Mac emulator (which
unfortunately doesn't handle the music very well), I can only
conclude that note value 1 means the note should continue playing.
At first I thought maybe it was supposed to fade the current note,
or perhaps change its volume, but I can't hear any traces of
either. So I'm going to assume it just means 'hold the current
note', though for the life of me I cannot think of any valid
reason for such a command. So it may be wrong, but it sounds
closer to the emulator than it did before.

The correction in 6046b8f1348a9a50ca09a257b5781a8ca2970d2d was not quite
correct as this was caused by a missing comma. This didn't cause a
compilation error as the code was still valid, just incorrect
i.e. (0x80<newline>-1, gaves 0x7f).

This parameter overrides any user choice in the GUI or config file,
which is not good UX design (and is making it hard to debug loading
issues associated with theme files).

If we want to set this to default to Modern, we should do this in
a different way i.e. do this by ConfMan.loadDefaultConfigFile()

This is probably related to the Android issue with the backend init
running before main() is called, rather than after...

sometimes not change it at all, causing the slider to seem stuck.

This fixes two minor issues when trying to cross-compile to Android on

However, this is still no working as DX and APKBUILDER are batch files
in the Win32 SDK (which then call the real Java tools) and these fail
to run in shell. However, using 'cmd /C' also fails as the paths in the
parameters have unix, rather than native separators. Unsure how to fix.

Now that we actually use the textalign field of Launcher.Version the version
would be left aligned by default. This looks odd for the classic theme and
the low resolution version of the modern theme and is contrary to the old
'default' value, so I decided to center the string explicitly again.

Before starting an 'Swav' sound, check that its sound handle isn't
already used. If it is, stop it. When skipping a movie, it still
(incorrectly?) goes through the motions of playing the remaining
frames, including starting any movie sounds on the way.

This would cause us to lose the handle to the sound that was
currently playing in the 'Swav' slot, and I *think* that's what
ended up confusing things. I'm still not entirely sure exactly
what was happening.

Before, cursor images were converted to 16 bpp, and anything that

Now, cursors images are drawn as 8 bpp with a cursor palette created

It would be nice if we only regenerated the cursor/palette when they

Apparently, in some movies the Smacker decoder would peek ahead
past the end of the bitstream, even though it didn't necessarily
use all of those bits later. Fix that by first checking how many
bits are still available. (This was originally reported for the
mg1shoot.smk cutscene in the 4 CD version of The Feeble Files.)

The original interpreter only used english commands in the terminal
even when playing one of the localised version (and even though
everything else in the terminal was localised). This adds the possibility
to either use the English commands or the localised ones.
Localized commands have been added for French, German (thanks to
SimSaw, who also proposed that idea) and Italian (thanks to Maff).

Since the music volume is set in playTrack(), it shouldn't be
necessary to set it back to the default level when a fade out has
been completed.

This change prevents the volume from spiking right before quitting
the game. I hope it doesn't cause regressions.

the next time it was brought up again it showed the 9th entry at the top
of the view and effectively hiding all the others. It furthermore did not
show the scroll bar because all entries would have fit onto one page.

To prevent this odd behavior, a boundary check has been added to all places
where the scroll position is set. This has been taken from 'scrollToCurrent'
which already tried to prevent this.

This fixes the second issue described in bug #3610960
'T7G - savegame glitches'.

This silences a clang warning. It seems like a good idea, too: non-ASCII
chars in string constants are prone to break as a result of (possibly
unintentional) encoding conversions (which one can configure git to

There are two ways that the music volume may be set:

The setSourceVolume() specifies the current music volume, as
ScummVM sees it. This is stored in _sources[].volume.

The MIDI data itself can trigger volume events. These are handled
by send(), which stores the volume - usually (always?) 100 - in
_sources[_curSource].controllers[]. The volume is then adjusted
by _sources[].volume.

When music is faded out, setSourceVolume() is called repeatedly
with progressively smaller values for the volume. What it should
do, then, is to make sure that the volume is set to what was
previously set to in send(), adjusted to the fading volume.

At least, that's how I understand it.

pushes the offset past the sample (repeat) length.
This is not error; the mixing function already handles this
case flawlessly. No assert() is necessary there.

The initializeLocals() function assumes that it can copy 25

was frequently a lot smaller than that. I've introduced a constant
for the number of locals (though VirtualMachineState has one more
for some reason), and fixed the array sizes in a number of places.

This fixes warnings that would appear after a little while in
Kyrandia 2, which would happen because every time the music
changed it would add a new loop point. This was probably harmless
because once the list was full it would keep re-using the last
element, and I imagine all songs were set to loop forever. But
this should be more correct, as I understand it.
