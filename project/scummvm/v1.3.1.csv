This is an attempt to fix the problem Max described in his devel mail.
The presence of the rom files will now be checked in detectDevice().
In case of failure there will be fallback attempts.
The user will get notified of the detection failure if he has expressly selected the device that failed.

Please test with your platform / engine (with or without rom files).
