It's a bad idea to cast a parameter to the 'is*' functions from ctype.h to 'char',
since 'char' might be signed and the 'is*' functions are defined to only accept
input which fits 'unsigned char' or equals EOF. In this concrete example the value
of 'state.ascii' is > 0x7F, thus becomes negative after the cast to 'char', which
violates the parameter rules of 'isprint'.

Sadly it seems this is not the only place in our code, which does pass a possibly
signed parameter to an 'is*' function. We might either want to change all code to
only pass an unsigned char value, change the code to do parameter validation or
fix it in another way.

The basic commands are done.  It remains to implement handling music (after
we play it at all), fading palette, and controlling the quick-hero and
speed-text flags (after I find out what they do).

Now the dragon switches between talking and staying during dialogs.  However,
the left/right direction doesn't work yet, because we don't respect _lookDir
and _useDir yet.

The auto-detection code *does* work for cross compilers, too. So it
should never be necessary to explicitly set _endian or type_1_byte etc..
But if for some reason this does not work correctly on your port, and
you have to re-add the explicit settings, please make sure to clearly
document this with a comment.

Note: Several ports set type_4_byte='long'. I added FIXME comments to
each code, asking porters to document the reason why 'long' must be used
instead 'int' resp. instead of the auto-detected type.

Fixed rounding issues in the whole game.  Improved debug messages.  Made sure that the dragon
does not turn like crazy around when clicking on the same pixel: the final point is always the
clicked one although the middle points made by shifted to make the animations smooth, and
preserve the dragons direction if he has not walked.

There is a bug with running turning animations as they seem to disappear for 1 frame and have
incorrect Z coordinate.  Will investigate it next.

I have tested that this could only possibly happen when the game has been
loaded with last location being the map.  Then pressing Escape calls
enterNewRoom() and this superfluous optimization takes place.  It is harmless
to simply reload the map.  After having removed it, enterNewRoom() needs not
return any return value, because the test at the tail can be done by the
caller.  I have then restructured the code a little to make it cleaner.

We will now output a warning to the user in this case. That should be fine,
since SCI is the only engine so far, which uses Dual OPL2 emulation.
Albeit this is not supported by our MAME emulator the user will still get
sound output, since the SCI engine will do proper recovery and fallback
to single OPL2 emulation, which is supported by the MAME emulator.
In case a engine would require a specifc mode (like OPL3) and the
user selects MAME emulation, this might result in no sound output
(or a crash), in case the engine does not take any care of testing whether
the OPL creation succeeded. But luckily so far no engine does this,
so it should be fine to not worry about that for now.

- Made the SciMusic class private, and added wrapper functions for invoking specific methods of SciMusic from outside the SoundCommandParser class
- Many SCI games keep creating and destroying sound effects constantly (i.e. many times per second). Therefore, another scheme has been devised, which replaces the mutex that was in place. Whenever a sound command is run which operates on a specific object in the play list, we disallow onTimer() from kicking in. This isn't ideal, but it does stop random deadlocks because of locked mutexes without any noticeable side effects

- Resolved a deadlock with the mixer, and added appropriate mutexes (a result of the fact that SCI mixes MIDI and digital audio in the same list)
- Fixed sound playing when loading games, by properly resetting the MIDI driver
- Reverted savegame version to 14 - the changes in versions 15 and 16 don't have any effect on the currently enabled old music code, and the new music code is disabled by default, and is still prone to changes
- Now saving/loading signal, loop and hold for each sound, as well as reverb
- Added stub code for setting reverb and channel hold
- The signal, loop and hold values of each song are cached, like in SSCI and like what happens in Greg's SCI implementation. This allows a clear separation of the engine code from the rest of the engine. Reverted commits 46792 and 46797
- Removed duplicate song list accessing code
- Song cues are now updated in kAnimate for SCI0, like the old music code does, to compensate for the fact that SCI0 didn't poll for music changes via cmdUpdateCues, like what SCI01 and newer do
- Cleanup

differently: We store a number of seconds, and frames. To make sure that
we can still handle milliseconds accurately, though, we change the
framerate to the least common multiple of the original framerate and
1000. So 60 becomes 6000, and 44100 becomes 441000. There are no visible

This makes sense as a default for CLUT8 modes, but not really
for anything else.  As part of the gsoc2009-16bit merge, the
default was changed to 'all ones', with extra code in the SDL
backend to truncate this to the depth of the mode.  However,
'all ones' (white) still isn't a very useful default for RGB modes.
So rather than jumping through hoops to provide a bad default,
it's better to remove the default altogether.  Engines which relied
on the old default of 255 have been updated to specify it explicitly.

there was no manageEvents-call in one of the versions that was

won't cause any regressions!

'Fix for bugging moving at the bottom of the ocean when trying to free the girl from the ropes and swimming to the surface.
