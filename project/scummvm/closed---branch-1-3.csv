Changed the default values from 'false' to 'true' as current devices are
fast enough to handle this. It's still possible to change the values to
'false' if the device isn't fast enough.

This fixes bug #2138118 ('KYRA2: WinCE:Music on Menu freezes and goes to infinity')

Replaces the formerly custom WinCE massadd function (CELauncherDialog::automaticScanDirectory) with the global one, which is better because it shows progress (massadd in combination with a uncached plugin build takes a very long time to complete and user thinks device has crashed when no progress is shown).
Also fixes the additional custom WinCE about dialog (text was cut off before).
