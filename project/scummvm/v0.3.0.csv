SDL-ism would even be better :-) ).

I think that it's better to compute the height with the modified
parameters and not with the original ones. Endy, otherse, please
comment :-)

Anyway, there seems to be some bugs remaining :

1) the save game menu is really weird looking (ie instead of having
the game name displayed in the top left, there is 'How may I serve
you ?' instead (maybe normal after all :-) and there seems to be
some black missing).

2) in the same code I move, there is this :

if(height > 200)
height = 200;

Why limit at 200 for a game that supports 240 :-) ?
