Extended workaround for Goblin Stuck On Reload to cover bug #3065914

This generalises the workaround added for bug #3018918 i.e. UOTODDV
issue, to cover the ICVGCGT case and hopefully all future cases, by
executing the variable correction during the reload after Game Over
and using the variable read by the script triggering the movement
lock, rather than the movement lock variable (59) itself as this
may not be set until a later script.

If a plugin has no statically allocated data at all, and no static
constructors/destructors, then __plugin_ctors et al will end up inside
a debug section, because the .ctors section and those following it
will be removed by ld for being empty.  This has the side effect of
those symbols being deleted completely when using strip -g to remove
debug info, causing loading of the plugin to fail.

This workaround just makes sure that the .bss section is never empty,
so that it will never be removed.  That way the symbols will be sure to end up in that section if all sections before are removed.
