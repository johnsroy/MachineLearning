- Support for the MPEG2 videos in BS1/2 has been dropped. The MPEG2 videos were lossy, and support for them complicated the code a lot.
- Support for the non-existing enhanced MPEG cutscene packs for BS1 has been dropped. As a consequence, the credits player and the splitted audio stream players used for these packs has been removed
- The original Smacker videos for both games are now supported, using our Smacker player (which is based off publically available specs and FFMPEG)
- The animations now use the common video player code. Both the Smacker videos and our DXA video packs are supported

When a script thread is waiting for another thread, the current instruction offset should not be modified. The thread processing function would incorrectly continue in some special cases, and would incorrectly alter the current instruction offset. This becomes apparent in some special cases only, which made it hard to spot - plus, SAGA games have not been tested for 0.13.0, so there weren't any reports for this.

This change SHOULD go to the 0.13.0 branch, but we've already tagged...

- new GUI/themes

- no more funky colors!

- load/delete saved games


- cleaned-up Makefile.PS2 :
- dropped multiple extra paths
- dropped deprecated deps (UCL, MPEG2)


- all possible devices are supported to store, play and save games:

- CD
- HD
- USB
- MC
- REMOTE ! (this could actually be anywhere on the internet
as long as you run 'ps2client listen' on the machine on
the other side that hosts the games)


- tested from :
- ps2link
- uLE
- toxicOS


- tested with:
- bass
- bs1
- mi1
- comi
- indy4
- ft
- ite
- ihnm
- elvira1
- dig
- kyra
- lure
- simon2
- goblins1

Played all those games in 1 session using RTL. Very smooth,
sub-second RTL experience. No crash!


- new PAL/NTSC detection : we are now reading the flavor from PS2 ROM,
it should work on all PS2 slim too


- new PAL TV centering : no more missing chunk of games on top/bottom


- we can now read the savefiles from Linux/SDL and other backends!
if you add that you can read them from remote together with the
games that you already have there, you can imagine the fun ;-)


- we fully implement RTL with every games/engine


- we nicely reboot / shutdown on quit


- fully support for themes/savegames paths. Run from MC, play the
games on remote and store your data on USB or HD. No limits!


- universal write/read for every media (of course no write on CD/DVD!)


- fully async / DMA read-write access to every media (even MC!)


- optimized cache/read-ahead for every media - now COMI is fast and
enjoyable from remote as it is from CD ;-)


- non polluting MC storage, just 1 folder + 1 icon, so that you can
copy all your settings / saved games to another MC in one go!

We tried to implement the list iterators in a clever way, to reduce code
duplication. But this is essentially impossible to do properly, sadly --
this is one of the places where the ugly drawbacks of C++ really show.
As a consequence, our implementation had a bug which allowed one to
convert any const_iterator to an iterator, thus allowing modifying
elements of const lists.

This rewrite reintroduces code duplication but at least ensures that no
const list is written to accidentally.

Also fix some places which incorrectly used iterator instead of const_iterator
or (in the kyra code) accidentally wrote into a const list.

Fix Operation Stealth's 2nd arcade sequence's revolving doors.
- Now the doors actually do revolve when before they didn't.
- The fix was to alias the 9th background with the collision
page directly when loading collision page data. This way
changes written to the 9th background go to the collision
page and vice versa (And there were changes in the labyrinth).
- Also converted _bgTable from a pure array to a Common::Array

- Fixed a bug in script_adjust_opcode_formats()
- Simplified the code in GfxResManager::getView() a bit

Added a SCI1.1 case in the lofss opcode, like in the lofsa opcode (essentially, lofss and lofsa both load an offset, with lofsa loading it in the accumulator and lofss in the stack). lofss is rarely used in SCI1.1 games, which explains why no lofss-related crashes have been observed in SCI1.1

Removed the weird checks for a maximum resource number (the sci_max_resource_nr array), as it doesn't serve any real purpose and leads to strange errors: if a resource is found which is bigger than the maximum number, it will be remapped to an incorrect number from this check. This makes KQ5CD work properly again (resources would be remapped to incorrect resource numbers from this code as a result of not updating this array with the latest SCI version merges).

By comparing the commit log of r42300, it seems that 'off' was renamed to 'lastDirectoryOffset'. I changed the SCI32 specific code to use that now. I can't assure this is anyhow correct, so anyone with knowledge of this code please check it.
........
r42305 | lordhoto | 2009-07-10 02:23:22 +1000 (Fri, 10 Jul 2009) | 1 line

Added a temporary work-around for PS2 backend in common/array.h
cause its vintage compiler does not support 'new T[newCapacity]()'
but only 'new T[newCapacity]', this will let it compile through.

It's ifdef'd as __PLAYSTATION2__, so it won't make a difference
for other backends with more modern tools.

ScummVM/PS2 bugs fixed by this commit:

- general file write corruption (eg. ScummVM.ini, etc.)

- COMI specific save crash / corruption
(added option in engines/scumm/saveload.cpp to disable
thumbnails on PS2, as emergency fallback in case the
fix should prove to be insufficient)

- implemented _screenChange logic
(fixes grabOverlay & COMI popup menu)

- fixed higher pitch (chipmunk fx)

- made NET IRXs optional to allow it to work on fat PS2 without net+hd

- fixed cursor restore on RTL

- added '.' as R2 to skip single lines of dialog

- added write cache

- Fixed CineMetaEngine::listSaves(const char *target) which was broken.
- Also added explicit initialization of savegame descriptions to
empty strings for safety reasons (e.g. arrays on stack aren't
initialized to zero).
- Added explicit trailing zero setting to savegame descriptions
(Previously using GMM you could write a description of length >= 20
that had no trailing zero when written to description file (e.g. fw.dir)).

Fix for #2824798 (FW: crash when clicking 'load' in the GUI):
- Fixed CineMetaEngine::listSaves(const char *target) which was broken.
- Also added explicit initialization of savegame descriptions to
empty strings for safety reasons (e.g. arrays on stack aren't
initialized to zero).
- Added explicit trailing zero setting to savegame descriptions
(Previously using GMM you could write a description of length >= 20
that had no trailing zero when written to description file (e.g. fw.dir)).
