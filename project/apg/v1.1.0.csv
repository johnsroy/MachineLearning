Update issue 56
Added a method for secure file deletion. We'll possibly have to test this a bit and make sure it actually *is* secure on the filesystems used (vfat for SD card, yaffs2 for phone flash memory by default). This sort of overwrite might be absolutely useless on some filesystems.
I also wanted to add an option at first, but this seems reasonably fast and in general it should be what the user wants, so for now it will ALWAYS securely delete. If there is a demand for plain deletion, then options can be added.

\n\nYou can also add a GMail account in the main activity via \'Add Account\', which simplifies decrypting emails received there.

Update issue 39
Two new strings:
<string name='section_advanced'>Advanced</string>
<string name='label_forceV3Signature'>Force V3 Signatures</string>

'V3' is just 'version 3' and should remain untranslated, both strings can be seen at the bottom of the preferences activity.

I encountered a problem that changing preferences in APG did not change

1. call getPreferences
2. change settings in APG
3. call getPreferences again

--> the result at 3. was still having preferences from 1.

To work around this, the function getPreferences has been updated to
force the new generation of preferences while not breaking any other
code relying on the old behaviour.

Since AIDL is not for passing large data, a blob can be passed to APG by
a Uri. This Uri is opened as a file by APG and read/written to. Note the
file is overwritten by APG, so make sure it is a copy if you want to
keep the original.

With the ApgServiceBlobProvider, Apg has an own ContentProvider that can
be used like mentioned above. For now the data is stored in the dir
where APG stores other files and NOT DELETED after en/decryption. This
is tbd. It can only be accessed by an application with the permission
'org.thialfihar.android.apg.permission.STORE_BLOBS'.

ApgCon has been updated accordingly and can handle blobs with `setBlob`
and `getBlobResult`. That is a really easy way to en/decrypt large data.

Note that encrypting by blob should only be used for large files (1MB+).
On all other cases, the data should be passed as as String through the
AIDl-Interface, so no temporary file must be created.

See ApgCon for a complete example of how to connect to the AIDL and use
it. Or use it in your own project!

The goal of these classes is to greatly reduce the needed static helper

Ideally only the pgp package uses BouncyCastle code, the rest of the
app should use this abstraction.

PublicKeyRing and SecretKeyRing exist only for cases where it is vital
that a specific kind of key ring is needed, for instance when it comes
to uploading to a key server, where a secret key ring must never be
used by accident.

The data returned by key.getEncoded() cannot be decoded on its
own by PGPObjectFactory. That'd require a key ring and with that
a master key.

The new serialization serializes the Key object and allows restoring
it accurately without creating a key ring as a workaround.

In PgpKeyOperation this requires adjusting the public key, as that
one is queried with isMasterKey(), and it is considered a master key
if subSigs == null. To avoid this, subSigs is initialized with an
empty ArrayList, resulting in a true subkey.
