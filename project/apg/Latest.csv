Change entire database design. This introduces a lot of changes,
notably all URIs and almost all projections. Some features (like key
deletion) have been simply commented out for now since they need
serious reconsideration. There are a couple of new TODOs marking places
where more work is needed.

The migration path works fine from what I tested. The old database is
not deleted for now, ie, it is reimported at every start of the
application making all intermediate changes transient.

Tested and working (for me):
- All activities in the main drawer
- Multiselect and Search
- ViewKeyActivity, with and without secret key available
- CertifyKeyActivity
- SelectSecretKeyActivity (from CertifyKeyActivity)
- SelectPublicKeyActivity (from encrypt activity)

What doesn't work:
- Actually certifying keys (pending a TODO in ProviderHelper)
- Importing keys doesn't preserve secret keys
- 'Encrypt to this contact' doesn't pass key
- Editing keys. All controls are disabled, I'm not sure why... (is this
even my fault?)
- Deleting keys

What I didn't test:
- Key export
- API stuff
- Creating keys (since editing doesn't even work)

GnuPG doesn't support expiry of user id certifications. The number

negligible.

ViewCertActivity now verifies the key and displays a status. For
revocation certs, the revocation reason is also shown.

When importing lots of keys, lots of messages about the status of keys
is generated, including some debug slime and general fluff that
isn't really needed a lot of the time. As a result, a serious bug can come
along after key imports or certain operations which cause a log to become
parceled.

This commit implements a pool to 'dehydrate' logs into: they are placed
into the pool (a ConcurrentHashMap) and a UUID assigned to them, which
is parceled along. When the OperationResult is un-parceled, it reads in
the appropriate UUID bits and rehydrates the appropriate log.

In order to avoid any memory leaks, the log pool removes a reference to
the log itself, allowing the log to die a natural death at the hands
of the GC..

The App crashed because the Adapter was trying to call a method on a
null object.

Where was the null object?
CheckBox was null because in the Layout file
view_key_adv_user_id_item.xml

There is no such widget with id = user_id_item_check_box

Fix :
I removed the two lines which were causing the bug, and now the screen
loads perfectly.
