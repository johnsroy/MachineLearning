The SensorElement class is an invisible sensor that notifies the field's delegate when a ball is within its area. This is used to implement a barrier that prevents the ball from going back down the launch lane after it's entered the field. Also added several delegate m ethods for custom actions when a game starts or ends or a ball is lost.
