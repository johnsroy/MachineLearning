"cb08778571aae50ae2aa16f2c909fe807d246793","2008-11-28 16:00:54+00:00","Allowed the service to shut down when there is an outstanding UserFailure.
Updated the scrobble_when string to be more vague, because of the workaround for checking for stopped tracks.

The wrong state would then be reported next time the service was started.
Added a debug message to help convince me that the stopped track workaround is working properly.
Incremented version code and name.
