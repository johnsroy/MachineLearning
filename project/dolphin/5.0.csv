Someone suggested on IRC that we should make a database of memory
locations in GameCube games which contain the 'Widescreen' setting
so we can automatically detect if the game is in 4:3 or 16:9 mode.

But that's hardly optimal, when the game actually tells the gpu
what aspect ratio to render in. 10 min and 6 lines of code later,
this is the result. Not only does it detect the correct aspect ratio
it does so on the fly.

I'm a little suprised nobody thought about doing this before.

For some dumb reason, llvm-config doesn't provide the flags to link
against the dynamic library copy of LLVM (as opposed to static), so the
script has to guess the library name.  However, in some installations
(such as mine), there is no dynamic copy, which caused Dolphin to fail
to link.  Change the script to do a link test.  If it fails, one option
would be to fall back on static linking, but I just have it fail to
detect LLVM, because statically linking Dolphin against LLVM is really
not a great idea - huge binary, long link time.

This change is meant to solve the following problem: how to translate the
following snippet to DSPHLE:
SendInterruptAndWaitRead(MAIL_A);
SendAndWaitRead(MAIL_B);

SendInterruptAndWaitRead(MAIL_C);

This should cause the following actions on the CPU side:
---> Woken up by interrupt
Reads MAIL_A
Reads MAIL_B
<--- Exits interrupt handler

---> Woken up by interrupt
Reads MAIL_C
<---

But with the current DSPHLE mail support, the following would happen because
the 'AndWaitRead' part is not supported:
---> Woken up by interrupt
Reads MAIL_A
Reads MAIL_B
<--- Exits interrupt handler

[Never gets the second interrupt since it was triggered at the same time as
the first one! Misses MAIL_C.]

This changes fixes the issue by storing two values in the mail queue on the DSP
side: the value of the mail itself, and whether a read of that mail should
trigger a DSP interrupt. If nothing is in the queue yet and an interrupt is
requested, just trigger the interrupt. In the present example, the queue will
look like this:
Mail value       Interrupt requested
MAIL_A                  No           <-- Interrupt was triggered when
pushing the mail to the queue.
MAIL_B                  Yes
MAIL_C                  No

When the CPU will read MAIL_B, this will cause MailHandler to trigger the
interrupt, which will be handled by the CPU when coming back from the exception
handler. MAIL_C is then successfully read.

On older versions there is no such concept of a 'back buffer' since positional

it would be really nice if we could support more of that inter-buffer mixing
(TODO :) ) it does not warrant a PanicAlert at this time.

It kind of sucks that we don't emulate some behaviors properly, but there is
very little ROI for some of these features and I'm not going to spend time
implementing them any time soon. Making the PanicAlerts optional allows for
more testing of the core features on more games while 'just' breaking less
important features like reverb.

In particular this optimizes the case where a 32bit float is loaded via lfs, and then used in double operations.
This happens very often in Gekko based code because the best way to load a 32bit value as a double is lfs since it automatically turns in to a double value.

There are a few other implications of this in practice as well. Like if both of the paired registers are loaded via psq_l and then used in double
operations it would be improved.
Also if we implement a double register we've got to be careful to make sure we understand if it is in 'lower' register or the full 128bit register.

Samsung updated the video drivers on the SGS6 which introduced a bug when disabling vsync.
Both the driver versions are r5p0, but the md5sums of the blob differ.
To work around the issue, make sure to never disable vsync by calling eglSwapInterval.

We can't actually determine the driver version on Android yet.
So until the driver version lands that displays the driver version string in the GL_VERSION string
we will need to keep this workaround enabled at all times, which is a bit annoying.

Current mali drivers return the video driver version in one of the EGL strings you can query.
The issue with that is that Android eats all of those strings, so we can't query it.

This is a bug that crops if BindToRegister() is called multiple times in a row without a R() function call between them.
How to reproduce the bug:
1) Have a completely filled cache with no host register remaining
2) Call BindToRegister() with different guest registers
3) Don't call R() between the BindToRegister() calls.

This issue typically wouldn't be seen for a couple of reasons. Typically we have /plenty/ of registers in the cache, and in most cases we only call
BindToRegister() once per instruction. In the off chance that it is called multiple times, it wouldn't update the last used counts and would flush the
same register as the previous call to it.

This instruction is fairly heavily used by Ikaruga to load a bunch of registers from the stack.
In particular at the start of the second stage is a block that takes up ~20% CPU time that includes a usage of lmw to load half of the guest
registers.

Basic thing optimized here is changing from a single 32bit LDR to potentially a single 128bit LDR.
a single 32bit LDR is fairly slow, so we can optimize a few ways.
If we have four or more registers to load, do a 64bit LDP in to two host registers, byteswap, and then move the high 32bits of the host registers in
to the correct mapped guest register locations.
If we have two registers to load then do a 32bit LDP which will load two guest registers in a single instruction.
and then if we have only one register left to load, load it as before.

This saves quite a bit of cycles since the Cortex-A57 and A72's LDR instruction takes a few cycles.

Each 32bit LDR takes 4 cycles latency, plus 1 cycle for post-index(which typically happens in parallel.
Both the 32bit and 64bit LDP take the same amount of latency.

So we are improving latencies and reducing code bloat here.

There are currently issues with banner scaling not preserving

Now in GLES they can properly support MSAA and also stereo rendering with MSAA enabled(with proper extensions).

snd_pcm_writei() is meant to block block until all samples are written,
but apparently in some situations it can block for much longer, prehaps
even a infinite time, in the case of virtual machine FifoCI runs in.

Because it grabed a mutex before blocking, it could also block the
Clear() call for an infinite length of time, blocking dolphin's emu
thread.

snd_pcm_writei() also takes 10-15 seconds if you run dolphin under GDB
and can randomly take 5 or so seconds during normal usage.

By moving all the pause code to the ALSA thread, Clear() no-longer
blocks and everyone keeps their sanity.

Before the columns of the gamelist were filled with content regardless
of their visibility. This led to display bugs when certain columns, for
example the region column, were hidden.

The first problem was the InsertItemInReportView() function because it
refilled all columns with content on every call to update() without
checking for their visibility. While this issue would have easily been solved
by adding conditionals before each column update, the maker column would
have still caused problems for it autohides on resize and those do not
call update(). Therefore it was necessary to move the column update logic
from InsertItemInReportView() to a new one that allows for seperate
modification of an item's columns.

It's used by both the GUI to do things like install WADs and check up on
the system menu, in which case the global root should be used, and by
/dev/es, in which case the local one should.  The latter isn't
*terribly* useful today, since no contents will ever be installed in
temporary roots (although it's still relevant for data directories), but
converting the whole thing makes sense because then it will Just Work
once the entire NAND is synced.

Because it would have been a bit of work to split it up (but I can if
desired), this commit also contains some basic cleanup of
NANDContentLoader:

(1) The useless interface class INANDContentLoader is removed and the
methods are changed to just return CNANDContentLoader (the only
implementation);
(2) CNANDContentManager is changed to use unique_ptr and cleaned up a

091db36 added a new delay for disc commands in an attempt to fix issues.
It fixed Sonic Riders crashing after the third level... or so we thought.
091db36 also happened changed the order disc reads happen in so that the
data is copied to memory before the emulated delay is finished. This was
inaccurate and caused an audio problem in Resident Evil 3, leading to the
old order being restored in 8cc6e5c. Now that the order is correct,
Sonic Riders is broken again, despite 091db36's delay still existing.
We're more or less back to square one - nobody knows what's broken, and
nobody knows how to fix it. This commit restores SUDTR to Sonic Rider's
game INI so that it'll work out of the box in 5.0 just like in 4.0.

This addresses a bit of thread unsafety mentioned in a comment, and

To make this work nicely, make PauseAndLock call DeclareAsCPUThread -
i.e. while you have the CPU thread locked, you can consider yourself the

It was only implemented in OpenGL, though the option was visible in both
backends, leading to memory leaks if you enabled it in DirectX.

And it wasn't particularly useful as a debug feature as it only showed
where in the EFB the copies were taken from, not what format it was, or
what the copy was used for, or what content was in the EFB at that point
in time.

Also, it stretched the copy regions relative to the window, so the
on-screen regions don't even line up with the window unless the game used
the full EFB (some pal games) and you game image stretched to the full
window.

We actually discovered a bug while combining the two functions with

postion or texture matrices were enabled and vertex arrays in use

indices, which would result in either too much or too little vertex
data being included in the dff.

So this commit also increments the dff version number, so we can
identify old broken dffs later.

'-TR' Wiimotes don't accept output reports via the Control Channel. HidP_SetOutputReports will send the data via the Control Channel, whereas WriteFile will send it via the Interrupt Channel. Therefore using WriteFile enables '-TR' Wiimotes on Windows. There are some issues to be aware of. First the Toshiba Bluetooth Stack needs the output report buffer to have the size of the largest output report supported by the device. This requirement is also enforced by the Windows 7 default stack. However the Toshiba Stack, will only send the actual report bytes to the device, whereas on Windows 7 the full resized buffer is sent, resulting in an error on the Wiimote. This issue renders WriteFile unusable on Windows 7 with the  default stack. On Windows 8/8.1/10 this requirement is somehow not implemented and it is possible to send smaller buffers via WriteFile to the device, enabling '-TR' Wiimotes.

This fixes changing the play/pause button's label depending on the
emulation state. Before, wxToolBarToolBase's SetLabel() function was
used. This function, however, is not implemented in wxGTK which leads to
the label not changing on linux when the button is clicked. Although the preferred
method (according to the wxWidgets documentation) to change the properties
of a tool is to use the toolbar's setters, there is no such setter for
the label. Therefore, this implements a workaround where the
button is deleted and readded afterwards with the updated properties.

Callers can now check whether reads fail, either by checking the return
value or by setting the buffer to a known bad value and seeing if it stays
untouched. I've added error checks to FileSystemGCWii and Boot_BS2Emu,
but not to Boot since it doesn't check any of its other reads either.

Commit 33487ab5f20309e33b4734dbea9201b5b0d893a2 introduced a regression
where items would vanish from the toolbar. This adds a call to Realize()
after the reinsertions of the play/pause button as required per
documentation.

Thanks to Simonwayneee for noticing this!

The Wii U Gamecube controller adapter setup has always been a bit weird. It tries to be as automatic as possible to make the user experience as easy
as possible.
The problem with this approach is that it brings a large disconnect in the user experience because you have the Gamecube controller setup with regular
gamepads and then for some reason below that you have a 'direct connect' option which will cause the Gamecube Adapter to overwrite the regular inputs
if something was connected.
While this works and allows the user to only click one checkbox to get the device working, it breaks the user's experience because they don't really
know what 'direct connect' means and won't look it up to figure out what it is. Just expecting the device to work (At least one occurence of this in
the IRC channel in the last week).

This way around also had the terrible nature of making the code more filthy than it needed to be. The GCAdapter namespace was parasitic and hooked in
to the regular GC Controller SI class to overwrite the data that it was getting from the default configuration.
Now instead we have a specific SIDevice class for the Wii U Gamecube adapter. This class is fairly simple and is a child of the regular SI Gamecube
Pad device and only reimplements what it needs to.
This also gives the ability to configure controllers individually, which allows the user to configure rumble individually per pad input.

Overall the code is cleaner, and it fits more in line with how the rest of Dolphin works.

Dolphin has supported the recalibration shortcut (X+Y+Start) for quite a long while. So if someont's axises are terrible, you could easily
recalibrate.
Games even get the initial calibration upon boot(Most of the time).

While changing over the GCAdapter code, I was testing to make sure the reset and calibration shortcuts still worked, turns out they didn't work at
all.
Looking in to the problem, we capture the combination properly, and we wait three seconds until we actually fire that off recalibration.
The problem is for Nintendo's SDK to properly handle recalibrating, we need to send back data saying that it needs to recalibrate.
On hardware this is done as part of the 64bits of data the controller sends back to us.
On holding of the controller, bit 61 of the return value is set, which the Nintendo SDK catches, and then signals immediately afterwards a CMD_ORIGIN
command in order to recalibrate the controller.
We were outright ignoring this bit, so the library wasn't ever recalibrating. I suspect in the past the class itself used to use the calibration data
to to offset the data, but somewhere along the lines it got munged out of existence.

The Gamecube adapter does this shortcut in a bit of a unique way, instead of sending the command and having the library support it and what have you.
Once holding the shortcut for the amount of time, the adapter reports back that the controller has actually been disconnected. Then when you let go of
the combination, the adapter states that a new device has been connected to that port, and the recalibration happens because a new device is
'connected.'

This fixes controller calibration for both emulated GC controllers and also the Wii Gamecube Adapter.

People who make texture packs usually release them using a specific ID
(for instance SX4E01). Users who have a different version of the game
(like the PAL version SX4P01) then need to rename the custom texture
folder to match. This is a lot simpler than renaming every texture file,
as was required with the old texture format, but it's still something
that users can forget to do. To make that unnecessary, this change makes
it possible to use three-character region-free IDs for custom texture
folders, similarly to how game INIs can use three-character IDs. Once
most people have updated to Dolphin versions that include this change,
those who make texture packs will be able to name them with
three-character IDs, removing the need for users to rename anything.

This is the only way to get Wiimotes working under Android now.
This, just like the Wii U Gamecube Controller Adapter, completely goes around Android's limitations and talks with the device directly through USBManager.

Couple notes.
Continuous scanning must be enabled otherwise the Wiimotes won't be seen.
The UI doesn't expose support for this yet. One must change the Wiimote source and continuous scanning settings manually.

Testing up to two wiimotes in Taiko No Tatsujin, no reason to believe all four won't work.

Make shutdown more robust by making the read thread control the write thread.

This PR installs an SVG icon to use as the main icon for dolphin in Linux
desktop environments (through the .desktop file) and removes the currently used
XPM icon. I've also added a 48x48 PNG for any desktops which don't support SVG
icons.

This has been the recommended way to ship application icons since forever
according to the Icon Theme Spec:
https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/icon-theme-spec/

This is also a prerequisite for dolphin appearing in the GNOME Software Centre
which does not support XPM icons.

Removes a couple asserts in the vertex shader gen when dealing with the input form.
Typically input form ABC1 is used, so it'll pull in the first three elements and always set the fourth to 1.0
The other input form available is AB11, which sets the last two components to 1.0 (Theoretically).
No titles actually use this input form that we know of except for Project M, but it can have some fairly drastic visual differences.

Confirmed correct by hardware test

The D3D backend was always forcing Anisotropic filtering when that is enabled regardless of how the game chose to configure the texture filtering registers; this causes the same issues as 'Force Filtering' without Anisotropy, such as causing game UI elements to no longer line up adjacent correctly. Historically, OpenGL's Anisotropy support has always worked 'better' than D3D's due to seeming to not have this problem; unfortunately, OpenGL's Anisotropy specification only gives GL_LINEAR based filtering modes defined behavior, with only the mipmap setting being required to be considered. Some OpenGL implementations were implicitly disabling Anisotropy when the min/mag filters were set to GL_NEAREST, but this behavior is not required by the spec so cannot be relied on.

bool is not always guaranteed to be the same size on every platform.
On some platforms it may be one byte, on others it can be 8 bytes if the
platform dictates it. It's implementation-defined.

This can be problematic when it comes to storing this
data to disk (it can also be space-inefficient, but that's not really an
issue). Also say for some reason you moved your savestates to another
platform, it's possible they won't load correctly due to differences in size.

This change stores all bools to savestates as if they were a byte in size
and handles the loading of them accordingly.

Disclaimer: I can't test if this works on xbox one controllers, i don't have one. But i have conformed that this UpdateMotors() is related to rumble for emulated wiimotes.

This partially reverts commit 'XInput: Apply immediately as well' (1958a10b6f5ba8348268b077f6410dadb2a20c8f) from pr # https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/pull/1560

Hopefully this fixes the xbox one controller rumble issue:
https://bugs.dolphin-emu.org/issues/9071

And in theory it might reduce the used usb bandwidth, as it was originally intended before pr 1560.

@JMC47: Please do a good amount of testing, to see if this breaks rumble for wiimotes or gamecube controllers emulated with xinput devices.

Fix Frame Advance and FifoPlayer pause/unpause/stop.

CPU::EnableStepping is not atomic but is called from multiple threads
which races and leaves the system in a random state; also instruction
stepping was unstable, m_StepEvent had an almost random value because
of the dual purpose it served which could cause races where CPU::Run
would SingleStep when it was supposed to be sleeping.

FifoPlayer never FinishStateMove()d which was causing it to deadlock.
Rather than partially reimplementing CPU::Run, just use CPUCoreBase
and then call CPU::Run(). More DRY and less likely to have weird bugs
specific to the player (i.e the previous freezing on pause/stop).

Refactor PowerPC::state into CPU since it manages the state of the
CPU Thread which is controlled by CPU, not PowerPC. This simplifies
the architecture somewhat and eliminates races that can be caused by
calling PowerPC state functions directly instead of using CPU's
(because they bypassed the EnableStepping lock).

The Core itself also did dodgy things like PauseAndLock-ing
from the CPU Thread and SetState from EmuThread which have been
removed.

Now with this commit, it even polls all local controllers at once, so it should have even less latency than master in a few setups. Like one player with 3 controllers and the 2nd one with just one controller.

Donkey Kong Country Returns is writing new data to some files in /tmp
when loading each level. But the savestate code was opening the files
a second time and reading some old and stale data out.

As of #3798, dolphin now correctly restores that stale data to /tmp,
which broke DKCR (and probally countless other games).

This PR closes all file handles before saving and loading savestates,
which flushes the data out and pervents this issue. (old savestates
are corrupted and will still cause crashes if loaded)
