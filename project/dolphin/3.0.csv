just the basename like libPlugin_foo.dylib. Dolphin then loads the
plugins relative to the compiled-in plugins directory.

This means that you won't have to reselect the plugins when running
different builds (in different directories) and is most obviously
beneficial on OS X where application bundles are not (should not) be
expected to stay in the place where they are first installed.

This is tested on OS X and Linux with local/global build options, but
not Windows. I don't anticipate any problems on Windows, but that OS
does have slightly different semantics with regard to path component
separators and file suffixes, so it's something to watch out for.

hotkey configuration working with wx 2.9, but it turned out to be
too tempting to use it to hack up OS X keyboard support using wx
key events in the 'old' input plugins.

It was with some reluctance that I used PAD_Input (and copied it
for Wiimote as well) as that is clearly a deprecated interface,
but this way the hack is contained within the old plugins for when
the switchover to ControllerInterface happens.

The idea is to provide stable keyboard support on OS X for both
GCPad and Wiimote while we debug HID keyboard and real 'mote code.

It works pretty well, although the wx approach does impose a few
limitations like no arrow keys and left/right side modifier keys
are considered equivalent.

Fixes a number of problems, including unreliable connection setup,
frequent disconnections, busy-waiting and shutdown deadlocks.

Motion Plus and nunchuk hot swapping now work and Wiiuse does a small
amount of queueing to prevent occasional dropped packets. The OS X
bluetooth stack has no internal input buffering and while a worker
thread can easily keep up with data coming from the Wiimote, the rest
of Dolphin can easily get behind if it is blocked by disk I/O or
similar. Mostly the Wiimote protocol recovers from dropped packets,
but sometimes the Wiimote would get out of sync and send a disconnect.
I wonder if the other platforms might benefit from a bit of queueing
at this layer as well.

Still doesn't support multiple devices, as I kept changing my mind
about how best to do it. I only have one Wiimote anyway..

One improvement to the Wiimote plugin that would be really nice would
be for the scan for new devices to operate continuously or periodically
like on a real Wii rather than just for 5 seconds at startup..

Patch from user gamepromcompany on the MacOSX_Build wiki page.

Add support for the Mac command key as a hotkey modifier in
WXKeyToString but present it as Control. WXKeyToString is used for
both hotkeys and menu accelerators, the latter only supporting
Shift/Alt/Control with wxWidgets.

wxSpinCtrl on wx 2.9 has a very small default size, so give the
window size ones a reasonable size.

Use wxFULLSCREEN_ALL when switching to fullscreen, which gets rid
of window decorations like the title bar. Note that to actually
be rid of it with wx 2.9 on OS X, you'll need this patch:
http://trac.wxwidgets.org/ticket/11701

Also remove a couple of files I had accidentally duplicated.

the linker gives strange errors when I try that. We also link
against third party libraries from Macports that haven't had
any magic 10.5 compat dust sprinkled over them, so maybe it
isn't very important anyway.

Move the OS X variable section in SConstruct upwards a bit to
have the settings apply to more of the config tests. SCons'
ParseConfig causes problems for the -arch tuples, though, so
the SDL check still isn't quite as comprehensive as it should

- RGB565: 2-3x speed up on all hardware
- Removed OpenCL compiler warnings (eg. redefine).
OpenCL is now optimally complete for DX9/OGL. The code is very fast on all supported hardware. No more updates are needed unless the spec changes or drivers improve. When I started, the OpenCL code was as slow or slower than CPU. Now, using the lowest end radeon that supports the code: a Radeon 45xx mobility, I experience a substantial 2-10x speedup over CPU. The benefits are more pronounced with modern hardware. A Radeon 5870 runs this code 20x faster than a 4550. Even ignoring speedups, the code benefits users by not using CPU for intermittent texture loads (unless GPU is your bottleneck). Instead, the CPU is able to do more important tasks.

Dual Core sync fix.
When the FIFO is processing data we must not advance the cpu cycles in CoreTiming because in this way the VI will be desynchronized. So, We are waiting until the FIFO finish and while we process only the events required by the FIFO.
This should fix Issue 2072 .
This affect to all games in dual core mode.
Please, You can test all games with VPS limiter auto, 60, 50 depending of the game and compare with prev revision.
For example now NSMB in the video Intro has 60 fps (prev 30 fps) :D or SMG does't need anymore FPS Limitter Hack to get 55-60 fps
Beside the slowdowns now are more softly and the fps more stables because the VI sync is almost perfect.

Removed 'recording' in old wiimote plugin and other not necessary functions(EEPROM reading, we 'll just do a reconnect instead to use default accel calibration data etc). Recording is not needed anymore(playback of recorded moves should be still working). Everything the recording feature offered, the new wiimote plugin does as well and even more. The cleanup will ease the port of the real wiimote feature into new wiimote plugin, which is still only offering emulated wiimote support. Billiard said he's now on it.:)
Wiimotes are now slighty more responsive and multiple wiimotes should harmonize now slighty better. This clean up was requested/inevitable and should have be done way more earlier. This 'might' break osx/linux builds, so please test. If your aware of any 'real wiimote' issues please post it in the comments as well(dont forget to state your OS).

Known wiimote issues:
1.) Possible wiimote disconnect on pressing the home button
2.) 1-2 Possible wiimote disconnects directly after starting a game
3.) Rumble causes lag. I don't think this is a wiimote plugin issue itself, I'm not sure tho. It would be interesting to know whether the lag still happens on emulated wiimotes as well, when the game tries to rumble.
4.) Connecting(pairing up and refreshing) a 2nd/3rd/4th real wiimote while having a game running/paused, might swap player slots and cause disconnects at that moment.
If u have more issues, feel free to post them, to have them all here collected once more to get a brief overview.
Apart from that, increase the wiimote read timeout @settings(20-200). If your  expecting frequent disconnects, restart dolphin, and don't open the wiimote gui before playing instead directly start games.

meant as a ideally persistent device instance number.

In a dynamic environment such as when dealing with USB/bluetooth HID's,
I am not sure how much sense such an id can make and it would probably
be better to identify devices by an opaque blob (and a printable string).

In any case, the OS X HID manager does not offer the illusion of a
persistent integer instance identifier.

A string in the form of the device's own name is not sufficient as on
e.g. my Macbook Pro, there are three HID devices all bearing the name
'Apple Internal Keyboard / Trackpad'.

For now, hijack the ControllerInterface id to mean the the HID usage
page number. This at least separates keyboards and pointing devices,
allowing the keyboard to be selected in the configuration dialog.

Also some minor cleanup.

with OpenCL will also run on 10.5 without OpenCL.

Build with OpenCL by default now, but keep the opencl build option around
until Linux also links OpenCL weakly, at which point it can go away.

Start to merge in the actions required to make the OS X application bundle
redistributable into the main build and let bundle=true be concerned only
with the optional step of creating a dmg.

Some people are building binary snapshots for OS X without applying the
install_name_tool fixups and besides, osx_make_dmg.sh doesn't fully handle
the internal dependencies between the wx libraries, so we need to be rid
of any external dependencies by the time 'scons bundle=false .' finishes.

Ideally we should just use static builds of the wx libraries, but the flat
namespace used by Objective-C for anything other than normally linked
dylibs (sadly not dlopen'ed dylibs) makes that difficult because both the
main binary and the plugins have wx linked in without any symbol ordering.

TBD: Either do automatic install_name_tool fixups for both the main binary
and the wx dylibs or find a workaround for the flat namespace problem.

replace efb to ram implementation by a hybrid approach.
explanation:
when copying from efb to texture, instead of make a copy to a texture or to the ram, copy the data to both, in hi quality to the texture and in native quality to the ram.
then instead of re-decoding the data from ram (very slow) use the data in the texture.
to improve this even more, test if the cpu has modified the data in the ram copy, if so, update the texture in memory and mark it as dynamic to avoid redundant work in future frames.
having all this implemented this is what is archived:
sms: full quality with scaled efb copies and fully functional goop cleaning :)
ztp: efb to texture speed with full map support.
nsmbw: this is a hard to emulate game, as it make a lot of shading and texture modification in cpu. it only have 35 fps in my system with new efb to ram but is 10 fps faster than normal efb to ram.
this game also show me another unimplemented feature, copy efb to multiple textures at the same time (is used to animate coins and other things in the world).
this is a remaining todo in efb to texture.
a lot of games should improve, so please test and let me know any regresion caused by this commit.
if everyone likes this the next step is, implement efb to multilpe textures and merge efb to ram and efb to texture.
then port to the other plugins.
enjoy.

normally (on a fresh install) be triggered by the user clicking on
the GUI.

This notably includes refreshing the game list. The progress dialog
used in the course of updating the game list relies on wxWidgets
being able to yield to its event handler which isn't started until
after OnInit.

In fact, we might want to consider just moving all the initialization
currently triggered by OnInit into AfterInit so that we can rely on
the event handler running there. This would mean that we don't have to
worry about whether those code paths are triggered by a user click or
run at init time. This will require some more testing, though.

For now just move automatic booting along as this requires the game
list initialization to be done.

We also could instead choose to special-case cases like updating the
game list and simply not use a progress dialog there if the event
handler isn't running, but this approach is clearly cleaner.

For a typical OS X app, one only needs to specify the SDK version and the
target OS version range.

Because we use OpenCL which is new in 10.6, however, we must be somewhat
more verbose in order to make use of the forward compatibility facilities.

Unfortunately, the critical bit that is required to have binaries built
on 10.6 work on 10.5, namely disabling the new compact __LINKEDIT format,
causes stack alignment crashes at emulation time on 10.6, so for now
Leopard users still have to build Dolphin themselves.

Hopefully, this stack alignment problem will turn out to be coincident
with lingering alignment issues.

Include the OS X version of the Cg framework in Externals as with the
Windows one. The header files appear to be the same in the Windows and the
OS X builds of the February 2.2 Cg toolkit, although they are differently
munged by what appears to be some automatic process, so no new duplicates.

Any upgrades to the Cg libraries will of course need to be done in sync.

I do hope that Sonicadvance1's GLSL work will enable us to get rid of Cg.

- Eliminate the useless check for cpu modifications option from efb to ram as it must be enabled always
- use constant names in dx11 for buffer length calculation instead to simplify code reading
- implemented scaled efb copy in opengl, still bugy in some games, the option is not in the gui but will add it when it works perfect
- Change the depth calculation behavior:
if the game use z textures is exactly the same as before.
if the game do not use z texture calculate z values in the vertex shader. the advantage id this approach is that early z culling is applied,
improving fill rate. this mus speed up things, even with ssaa and msaa enabled.

- More removal of unnecessary code
- Windows: Modification of Wiiuse_Find under windows,
instead of always deleting and recreating the whole wiimote_t struct, we do maintain the old one,
adding/removing new wiimotes to/from it
- some wiimote bugfixes, see below for details

Windows related stuff:
Fixed most of the disconnection issues (single and mulitple real wiimotes, both wiimote plugins) (I haven't had a disconnect msg in hours anymore(ms stack)).
Rumble bug should be fixed now(both plugins,pls verify).
Fixed some pair up issues( sometimes you had to press the pair up button up to 3 times, till it paired up your wiimote).
More dongles might be now supported via ms stack, pls try and report back!
Fixed a problem where multiple wiimotes would swap slots on pair-up/addition of a real wiimote (2-4 real wiimotes) (both plugins, but not integrated into new plugin).
Improved ingame auto-pairup for real wiimotes(thx to the new wiiuse_find routine).
Fixed a bug on setting wiimote timeouts, which means changing the timeout was just a dummy earlier.
Most of the stuff concerns stuff in the old wiimote plugin, dont worry, in the end it's important for both plugins. It will get ported to the new plugin sooner or later.:')
Some minor stuff.
This might break osx/linux build and maybe the new plugin realwiimote-wise only. Thx to glennrics to pointing me to some breakings on linux, I didn't fix them all.
PS I hope i haven't forgotten anything, enjoy.

* Merge some loops in PPCAnalyst::Flatten()

Thanks to booto (PowerPC) and nash (testing) who spent many weeks of their time helping me make this work.  Also thanks to shuffle2 for finding and converting the map file of the original target.

There are two options for MMU emulation found under the game properties.  'Enable MMU' is the accurate emulation option.  'MMU speed hack' is the old TLBHack renamed. Most games will work with one or the other.  Some games can work with both options ticked.

Only the JIT recompiler and Interpreter work with the MMU code.  JITIL is not supported (too hard for me to add).

The speed optimised code still needs a lot more work and is disabled for now.

The GCC model for extended instructions like these is that you compile
with -msse3 etc. These affect code generation for whole compilation units,
so the idea is that you have a separate .c file for each instruction set
class and then indirect to the desired one at runtime.

Without e.g. -msse4.1, the GCC built-ins used by <foointrin.h> are not
available. However, in our specific case of compiling with -msse2 and
wanting to use SSE3.1 code, enough built-ins are available that we only
need to provide a little hack for pshufb.

Upgrading this to also use SSE4.1 instructions doesn't appear feasible
without a lot of undesirable duplication of GCC built-in functions and
headers, so we'd probably have to move to the GCC model of separate
source files for that.

* Some fixes to linear interpolation
* Adds interpolation to ADPCM samples
* Relaxed a volume limit in ADPCM_Vol






Fixed:
- Frac rolls over one iteration before samplePos advances. Can introduce noise similar to flipping samples (1234 => 1214). Introduced oldFrac to fix this. This isn't as noticeable as it probably should be because of below.

- When samplePos doesn't advance it interpolates between two copies of the same sample which actually does nothing. Changed it to always use the current and next sample.

- When frac is 0 you should get 100% of yn2 instead of ~99% added a +yn2 to balance it.


Other changes:
- Added linear interpolation for ADPCM. Sounds like a good idea.

- Set ADPCM_Vol to clamp to x8000 instead of x4e20. Some games will play some sounds at x8000 volume anyways since the volume is applied before this. Lower limit can result in quiet music (x4e20) but some loud ambient sounds (0x8000).

It can be activated in the DX9, DX11, and OpenGL plugin GUI's. Enabling the hack while playing other games besides ZTP will likely have either an undesirable or no(more likely) effect.

The code changes disable the usual pipeline flush for certain BP Writes that occur while the minimap is being drawn in Zelda: twilight princess. This significantly increases speed while in hyrule field. The way this is accomplished is described more in depth on page 42 of Xtreme's thread. Big thanks to Xtreme for doing a great job hosting that thread, and Kiesel-stein for initial work on the hack

Also, I used the resource editor in Visual studio to generate the GUI code for the DX11 plugin, and some code appeared to be removed, although the behavior of the GUI did not seem to change. Hopefully someone more experienced with resource files (forms?) can double check that no code was damaged

Remove a member variable which I introduced in r5907 although it never actually got used. Restores binary compatibility (at least in that regard) to pre-r5907 video plugins, but breaks any binaries after that :P

Update FIFO watermark tightness recommendations. 1000 is quite a high value I guess, but some people seem to need it.

Real/Emulated buttons are combined. Real acceleration data is used. Currently, emulated IR data is used.(might change this to allow both) Switching between an emulated and a real extension in-game is a bit testy right now, but if you switch the emu-extension to 'None' before connecting a real extension, it usually works.

Really that happens because the fifo.CPReadWriteDistance is negative.

In SMG this is because  PI_FIFO_RESET is writing and after fifo.CPReadWriteDistance will be setted to 0.
To Prevent that, I've Implemented AbortFrame function in the CommmandProcessor. It should fix overflown because of that.
Note: There is other issue (Issue 2846) where the fifo.CPReadWriteDistance is negative too but the effect is different.

However I could not find the bug in the function. Then I thought there may be bugs in folding rules in IRBuilder because there are some untested folding rules which fold and, or, xor, etc. (This is also written by myself. I'm sorry.) I tested some folding rules and commented out the other untested rules.

Like netplay, some emulator options (specifically dual core and idle skipping) can cause desyncs, and the more your plugin options are similar to the ones used during recording, the more likely playback will sync.

Also, input movies are now linked to savestates instead of just selecting a file to save to and running a game and are exported at a later time. This allows you to easily continue a recording across sessions and makes rerecording possible.

Perhaps someone with knowledge of the video plugins will be able to fix the things I have broken more easily than me(or point me in the right direction). I will continue to work on it as well.

DX11 is functional with a ~2MB/s mem leak.
OpenGL/DirectX9 have a black display while game runs. (DirectX 9 flashes good display on emulation stop)
Too many virtual function calls. (once everything is working, I will work on removing them)

The 'Enable Progressive Scan' option in the Wii menu now controls whether the Wii/GC will detect a progressive scan display.  This affects the timing of some games (both GC and Wii).  Usually, the checkbox should be unticked as progressive scan displays require higher bandwidth.

This fixes the slow speed in NBA JAM.  This also fixes the hang in Megaman Network Transmission.  This should fix Deadly Creatures (turn off progressive scan).

This implementation will decrease performance if the game uses this feature, but the glitches will be gone. I'll add an option for this in a later commit. EFB pokes are somewhat slow in DX11 right now, speed should be okayish in DX9 though.

Other changes:
- SOMEWHAT cleaned up the EFB access code in DX9
- Fixed incompatible parameter list of AccessEFB and TVideo_AccessEFB.
- Fixed a theoretical bug in ReplaceRGBATexture2D, add support for STAGING textures
- Removed unused parameters in various DX9 functions

Some notes about this:
- config.h doesn't get written yet, so you'll have to use one generated by SCons
- dependency checking isn't really implemented, yet. Just some basic checks for OpenGL or ALSA, we need something more sophisticated though.
- the OpenGL plugin fails to load for some reason which I can't debug right now due to the libc debuginfo package version in openSUSE not matching the runtime packages
- there's even some support for generating install packages (rpm/deb/.. packages, NSIS installer, etc). It doesn't work properly right now though, since some paths seem to be hardcoded into Dolphin's source
- probably lots of other stuff I forgot... Just take a look at all the TODOs in the CMakeLists.txt files for more information ;P

The colorEnable and alphaEnable parameters are obsolete, for some reason directly using them caused the SMS glitch with DX11 (because of that bpmem.zcontrol.pixel_format == PIXELFMT_RGBA6_Z24 check in BPFunctions.cpp, is this one actually correct?)

The comment in BPFunctions.cpp was at least misleading (if not even wrong), so I removed it.

I am officially killing the local/global build crap.  The 'local' build thing should never have existed.  There is now only one build that is essentially what the 'global' build was before.  This is the way a proper build system should work.  I will soon write a wiki page to describe how to properly use the cmake build system, and how you can still set things up to get the 'local' build from before.  However, that type of build should be considered a developer tool, and not the way that dolphin-emu should be built.
Briefly, to use cmake now do the following from the toplevel of dolphin's source:
mkdir Builddir
cd Builddir
cmake ..
make
make install (you may need superuser privileges)

Note that the scons build is still building dolphin in the old way.

The finding was that 99% of the time, textures are static in memory. However, Dolphin would pessimistically continue to decode and copy the same texture every time.  The optimisation is to check if the texture matches what is in the cache, and if it does, Dolphin should early exit.

The result is the speed in New Super Mario Bros Wii increased 35% with spinning coins.  Still not as fast as EFB copy to texture though.

Set scons build to autodetect OpenCL by checking for both the library and header instead of having an option.  Unfortunately there probably needs to be a path variable that can be set to the location to look for the headers.  For example on Ubuntu with nvidia, the headers are located in /usr/include/nvidia-current instead of /usr/include, and hence not found by scons.

Although curiously enough, linking the dolhpin executable against the system shared library SOIL fixes the problem too.  It doesn't work with the static version of SOIL build in the externals.  The reason the problem disappeared with the scons build is that the executable is implicitly linked against GL since the linker flags are set up to be thrown in everywhere.

Most of the code dealing with the LogTypes namespace was C which lead to a
lot of nonsensical casting, so I have dumbed LOG_TYPE and LOG_LEVEL down to
plain C even though the move of wiiuse into Source means we don't currently
call GenericLog from C.

Set logging threshold to MAX_LOGLEVEL at startup so debug builds will also
p  rint debugging messages before the GUI is running.

For some reason the way we use SetDefaultStyle doesn't play nice with wx 2.9
so we just get the default black text on a black background. Using a gray
background works around that problem, but I found it to also be much easier
on the eyes so I have switched the background color on all versions.

- Improved the GP Register Status: now this is all the time from the fifo loop.
- Improved the Interrupts manage:
1) Removed All UpdateInturrupts from CommandProcessor Writes and Read.
2) now the CP interrupts are schedule from the video thread and the fifo loop waiting until this happens
3) considering Inmediate mode for the CP interrupts
3) Implemented Interrupt CP Cache State
4) Implemented only Overflow interrupt in GatherPipeCheck because this need to be detected quickly.
- Implemented Overflow handling like a real HW, when Hiwatermark interrupt happens this write ClearRegister with True en HI and False in LO (FifoIntReset) after that a Control Register is writed and the FIFO is processed  to LO Watermark.
- Removed all ugly code from LO and HI watermark manage
- Removed all ugly code from BP manage
- Change >= by == in the BP clauses
- Removed speed hack (1024 chunk) for better GP Status Control.
- Commented GXSetGPFifo very soon hack
- Commented FackWatchDog hack
- Commented FIFO_RW_DISTANCE = WritePointer hack

This is the beginning and the base for the future., If this broke your favorite game my apologize, only report this and will try solve it. If you have a Overflown don't worry, I've implemented the real solution code using the Overflow Interruption only need continue working for a perfect protection. Why I did it? Because is preferable a accurate and clean fifo instead hack y fifo for improve that. Thanks to DONKO for you awesome Video Plug in and skid for the chatting. PD: I have 7-10 fps more in the star fox video. bye :P

1) What is the FIFO? The fifo is a ring queue for write (CPU) and read (GPU) the graphics commands.
2) What is the Brakpoints? The breakpoint is the FIFO mark to allow parallel work (CPU-GPU) When the GPU reached the breakpoint must stop read immediately until this Breakpoint will be removed for the CPU.
3) What is an overflow? The CPU write all room FIFO possible, and like a ring overwrite commands not processed yet.
4) ¿Why you have an overflow? In theory should not have an overflow never because the fifo has another mark (High Watermark) When the CPU Write reach this mark raise a CP interruption and the FIFO CPU WRITES should stop write until distance between READ POINTER AND WRITE POINTER will be equal to another mark (LO Watemark to prevent and overflow.
5) ¡So if impossible why you have overflows? Simple, the CP interruption is processed later and the Overflow happens. (there is a lot of theories about this)
6) ¿Why is no so simple like when CPU WRITE POINTER is near to the end of the FIFO only process pending graphics command?
Because when this happens sometimes we are in BREAKPOINT and is IMPOSIBLE process the graphics commands.

- This HACK process the pending data when CPU WRITE POINTER is 32 bytes before the end of the fifo, and if there is a Breakpoint force the situation to process the commands and prevent an overflown.
In theory you have not see 'FIFO is overflown by GatherPipe nCPU thread is too fast!' anymore. But if you have a hang in game where you had this please read the NOTICE LOG in user\logs, I've added this message 'FIFO is almost in overflown, BreakPoint' when the hack is activated. (I will delete this message very soon)

Good Luck!! PD: Shuffle sorry for the large commit description :P

~25% speed improvement in decoding GX_TF_RGB5A3 textures which aren't used very much. I thought it would help for movie playback but I misled myself. Video playback has nothing to do with this texture format.

to allow both system-side (also Windows) and per-user installations.

The IPL ROM is another candidate for this, but I don't have an
image to test with.

Perhaps a more general solution would be to just phase out the Sys
directory. As used for data which would have been available in ROM
or flash on the real hardware, it really contains two classes of
files that are both read-only during emulation:

- Settings and font files, which can be freely distributed
- ROM files which must be obtained from the user's own GC or Wii

Since the two could be freely put together on Windows without any
problems and with the users of that platform being resistant to
change, it may be easiest to just treat Sys as another directory
to be copied from the application bundle into User/Sys at startup
on non-Windows.

the occasional HLE wiimote disconnection, although nowhere it was at
near the level before both the recent wiiuse integration and adding
the queue in the first place.

The callback-based bluetooth input method on OS X really requires
that packets be accepted immediately and the 1ms polling done by the
wiimote worker threads isn't quite good enough.

So just play along with the native OS X model and send the packet up
our stack directly from the callback. With our current API, this is
kind of a layering violation, but it seems less messy than either
putting back internal queueing in IOdarwin.mm or adding the platform
support for higher-frequency polling than what usleep(3) offers.

Perhaps we should just change our own API to a callback model. While
this makes no real difference right now, it would make it a fair bit
cleaner to accept new wiimotes at any time instead of having to click
Refresh, although with the recent realmote changes, that feature can
probably just be hacked in by looping around FindWiimotes().

For other platforms having problems with HLE disconnections caused by
dropped bluetooth packets, as a first stop I would suggest trying to
do more than just one wiimote->Read() per iteration in the thread.

This change also conveniently sidesteps another new IOdarwin.mm bug
where the discovery and I/O code would clash during a refresh because
they use the same default CFRunLoop, so if we switch back to using a
run loop for I/O, must remember to create a separate one.

(rvalue references are used if available, <thread> is used if possible) Eliminates the need to use dynamic memory allocation for threads, so it's impossible to forget to delete a thread or set a pointer to NULL.

I've made sure the code compiles in vs08 and tested the functionality of 'StdThread.h' on Linux so I'm hoping everything will work :p. In the future 'StdThread.h' can be removed (maybe when OS X ships with gcc 4.4 and vs2015 is released :p).

Things left to do:
* The UI on the new Audio tab for the LLE/HLE choice is ugly
* At times the code still look 'plugin-y' and needs cleanup
* The two plugins should be merged further. DSPHLE should use the emulated memory etc of DSPLLE as much as possible, so that simply saving the DSPLLE state is enough. This would also bring the possibility of savestate compatibility between the two plugins.

and use wxGetKeyState on platforms other than Windows.

I am not sure if wxGetKeyState is unreliable on Windows or if
the use of GetAsyncKeyState() is simply historical, but for now
I've left the Windows call in there just in case.

This does mean that Host_GetKeyState() is currently only valid
for the small set of keycodes that overlap between wx and Win32,
one of which is VK_TAB/WXK_TAB.

Anyway, please test wxGetKeyState on Windows and remove the
ifdef if it works, so we can extend it to the remaining hotkeys.

Many linkers also expect static libraries to form a strict DAG
which turns out be a difficult rule to uphold in practice,
especially since some of our platforms aren't picky about this.

LTO builds currently appears to crash at runtime because of
the static wx libs.

I think that isFifoBusy bring better sync with VI (video interface) because the CPU emulated threads are waiting for DrawDone in BP Register. So, I do some modifications.
1) Rename 'IsFifoBusy' by 'isPossibleWaitingSetDrawDone'
2) Only activate isPossibleWaitingSetDrawDone when bFF_GPLinkEnable is true in fifo loop 'Inmediate mode' that is because in theory this drawsync function is using in this mode.
3) Deactivate isPossibleWaitingSetDrawDone also in SetFinish in PixelEngine, beside when 32 block is finish.

Please regression in yours games thats can bring some FPS more above all with VPS frame limiter ON (Auto, 60, 50, etc).

- Fix waiting in AbortFrame(), please test mp1/mp2 is fixed again.

To activate this function, start the game and use the 'Start recording' command.  A save state will be created at that point in time and the emulator will start recording.  This results in two files, a .dtm containing the movie and a .dtm.sav which is the save state.

Changes:
* Allow events to be scheduled when the emulator is not running.  This allows the save state event to be added before the emulator starts.
* Removed the Audio back-end init flag from the save state.  This value should not be saved as it is not data relevant to guest machine.
* Allow a recording to be started at any time (apart from when a recording is already being made).
* Updated the status bar and title bar when an on-screen message is shown
* Removed the saving of PEToken from the save state as the FIFO will save this information
* Added a couple Pixel Engine interrupt states to the save state
* Added the copyright notice to the GCPadStatus.h file.

- ReImplementing Single Core Mode like Dual Core Mode Style.

- Stage 1: My goal is, we have the Fifo, CommandProccessor code the more clear, maintenible and documented possible. When I quit dolphin I want any developer can continue with the work only reading the code.

* Big Refactoring: A lot of functions was changed the names, and modularized.
Now the FifoLoop and CatchUpGPU does not exist, was replaced by RunGpu() and RunGpuLoop().
The general idea is modeling the code like the real HW. The fifo is only a buffer where the Write Gather Pipe write the commands and from the Graphic Processor read these.
* Big Clean UP a lot of obsolete code and comments was deleted, like DcFakeWachDog, 'Fifo very soon hack', etc.

In the stage 2, I will refactoring more code doing emphasis in the division of CommandProcessor, Fifo, Gpu Emulation. Beside I will comment all functions and variables in the code (Don't worry I will ask for English help for this part ;) )

Please test a lot SC mode and DC mode :)
Thank you so much for testing always and the patience. I don't like broke your favorite game but... you must believe me this part is very sensible, I only try to contribute for have a better and stable dolphin emulator.

problems when the now persistent device connections could be
initiated by either opening the wiimote config dialog or starting
the emulation.

This same thread doesn't necessarily have to be the main (GUI)
thread, but it fits with the current other init case in the wiimote
config dialog and doing it in the main thread and would be required
if we should want to use the IOBluetoothUI framework in the future
for having the user input a pairing key for permanent syncing.

Also move a few other bits of code from the emu thread function

- Remove the 'val_base' hack, as it breaks hexadecimal values beginning with '-'.
Simply passing 0 as the second parameter to ToULong() is enough, as mentioned on this page: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5k9xb7x1%28v=VS.100%29.aspx
- Changed the error message (and some of its translations) to reflect that octal values are now auto-detected ('supported') as well.

To users:
Note that values beginning with '0' (not '0x' nor '0X') are now interpreted as octal values instead of decimal values. So be careful when using those!

Second:
A experiment. implemented parallelization in texture decoding using openmp. is most a experiment to test the performance in different os/plataforms. in my system (windows x64 amd 1055t) give a speedup in large textures, but i tested in in intel dual core and gives a slowdown. o i limited the use for large textures and cpus with more than 3 cores.
please test an let me know if it improves or degrades the speed.
please for linux and osx user. to enable this you will have to enable your compiler support for openmp to test this code.

Now po files can be updated as often as we want without bumping up the svn revision numbers of dolphin itself.  I left the dolphin-emu.pot and primary build files in the primary dolphin-emu svn.  The dolphin-emu.pot file will still need to be updated on occasion to reflect changes to strings in the program.  The gettextize script will still work as before for this.
Also added Arabic translations to the build thanks to mansoor.

With wxWidgets 2.9.2 now in Externals, SCons was the only
external dependency other than Xcode and building just SCons
from Macports caused a fair mount of extra stuff to be built
unnecessarily, so just include a copy of scons-local.

Always build wxWidgets from Externals which allows us to get
rid of the home-grown autoconf machinery in SconsTests.

The main use case for args.cache was the wxconfig option,
which is no longer relevant after the above changes and
caching options has a lot of potential for confusion,
especially since other build systems don't tend to do this,
so we no longer do it now.

It now works in the debug builds, but not in release builds for some reason. I'm not used to big projects like this so it's probably something obvious that I'm missing. Exclusive full screen mode seems to need the fullscreen resolution for the backbuffer when the DX device is created, so I used adapters[adapter].resolutions[f].xres and yres to get that, but in release builds, that gives me the windowed resolution (in debug it give me the fullscreen res, like I believe it's supposed to), which it reallly doesn't like.

It's not a difficult fix probably, but I've been staring at my monitor in confusion for too long now and need to get to bed. If anyone wants to test, you can still enable the 3D Vision option, it just wouldn't be 3D (obviously).

I knew it would be something tiny. 3D Vision is fixed now, I'll make this 3D Vision specific if it causes any problems, but I've tested it and it seems fine.

For anyone interested, because fullscreen wasn't set for wx first, the menus and stuff were being included in the size of the frame (which is being used for the backbuffer size), so it was getting 1920x1062 or something weird like that (for 1080p). In the render function, it then checks to see if the frame resolution is equal to any supported resolution and if it isn't, bumps you down to 640x480, apparently an unsupported 3D Vision mode... though now I think about it, I'm not sure why it wasn't messing with regular fullscreen mode.

This would have been so much easier with a working mouse...
I'm not even joking, my replacement mouse just arrived at the door...

I believe this makes Dolphin more reliable than GCNcrypt v1.1 which seems to add (prepend) a buggy line when decrypting...

- Split lines using SplitString() once more (as done with ' ' and '-' already), instead of relying on find() and substr() and the (size_t)line variable.
- Rename some variables, use a for() loop instead of a while() loop.

- Apply the StripSpaces() function to each line before attempting to parse them as encrypted/decrypted AR code lines.  Without this, lines such as 'B1PD-DXRQ-GTRKM ' (notice the unexpected space character) would be recognized neither as encrypted nor as decrypted, which could result in badly decrypted codes (a problem I had tried to explain here: http://forums.dolphin-emulator.com/showthread.php?pid=153532#pid153532).

- For the sake of error-checking, after pressing OK, throw a warning in the following situations:  when a line of code is not in a valid encrypted or decrypted format, and whenever the resulting decrypted code doesn't contain any lines.

Hopefully you'll be able to perform the following steps without errors now:
1. Open any game in Dolphin;
2. Go to Tools->Cheats Manager, and open the 'Cheat Search' tab;
3. Preferably set the 'Data Size' to 8-bit (the smaller, the more initial search results);
4. Press the 'New Scan' button;
5. Use the 'Unknown' search filter (which won't narrow the results down at all);
6. Press the 'Next Scan' button.
