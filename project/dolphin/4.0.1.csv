Both games don't need projection hacks any more, they work perfectly fine with all backends. Skies of Arcadia actually had an issue of improper shadows with the projection hack if opengl and d3d9 was used in latest dolphin builds.

Apparently it's not easily possible to install 32 and 64 bit in parallel when the Program Files folder has the same name. Still, we go without the version number in the folder name though.
