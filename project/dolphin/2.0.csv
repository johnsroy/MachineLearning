- Some joysticks dont have a real hat (POV) but fake this with buttons.
In this case Joystick (no hat) should be selected.
After this is selected, four new buttons will appear for the d-pad.
- Next version will probably include keyboard support.

- Added some kind of rumble support (windows only, using direct input).
- Only usable for player one.
- Not customizable, fixed rumble strength.
- Due to some Dolphin bugs you need to initialize rumble support manually.

How to use:
- Disable the 'render to main window' in the video plugin (opengl or d3d).
- Start the game and wait a few seconds.
- When the game is running, press the 'half press' button once.
- Rumble support should now be enabled (if your joypad supports it).
- Confirmed to work with Crazy Taxi.

Dolphin bug:
When void PAD_Initialize(SPADInitialize _PADInitialize) is called, the render window does not excist yet. Therefor the value _PADInitialize.hWnd is incorrect.

In order to initalize rumble support, it is required to set the CooperativeLevel to 'DISCL_EXCLUSIVE | DISCL_FOREGROUND'. But without a proper hWnd this will fail.
So the trick I used here is, let the game start and create a window (and a hWnd). After that I set the CooperativeLevel.

This was needed for the three Namco games Baten Kaitos - Wings, Origins and Tales of Symphonia to recognize that it was booting CD2. The critical value was the Disk ID byte 0x00000006 in the memory and on the disc, for these games it was 0x00 for CD1 and 0x01 for CD2. I'm not sure if any other multidisc games are affected by this.

This should give a reasonably ambitious person a fair chance to upgrade his savegames to the new version. - Please remember to make backups before any attempts to try it. I tried it with SSBM PAL and Mario Sunshine NTSC so I'm confident that it works, just try again if it fails.

Usage: Open your savefile, for example MemoryCardA.raw in a hex editor and update the gamecode and makercode according to yagcd 12.3.1 for the game you want to fix. And remember to update the tag on both locations, both Directory and Directory backup as explained in yagcd. Then open the file, still MemoryCardA.raw or whatever it's called in the Memcard manager (found under the Misc menu). That should correct the checksums. You don't need to do anything else after that, don't click Copy for example. Just close the Memcard manager and use the savefile in the latest revision.

I moved the initialization of DLLdebugger from Core.cpp to the debugging window. (I hope this doesn't break the LLE debugger in any way, or does it have to be started right after LoadPlugin?). Also added a ShowOnStart saved setting to the debugger. And a MainWindow saved setting that set the position and size of the main window when it's started. I may have broken things in the debugger by allowing disabling of for example the Jit window. Please accept my apologies if that is the case.

There's an annoying problem with the DSP HLE wx window that blocks some input and places it in a queue. For example if you have loaded the window and press X on the main window, that action is blocked an placed in some kind of queue and not executed until you have closed the debugging window. This is also why the main Dolphin-Debugger window does not show up until you close the sound window. If someone find a fix to this I guess it could be convenient. There is another way to show the window, m_frame->Show() that is normally supposed to remove this kind of on-focus lock, but in a dll it seemingly breaks because it makes Dllmain call DLL_PROCESS_DETACH immediately after DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH so the window has to be killed or we crash.

Also, otherwise unnecessarily I had to disable the new DSP HLE debug window in Release mode because I could not access the SConfig::GetInstance().m_LocalCoreStartupParameter.m_strDSPPlugin.c_str() string that I need to start it (if I tried it crashed). Very annoying and strange. I could not access m_strDSPPlugin or m_strVideoPlugin either, but all other values in m_LocalCoreStartupParameter seemed to work fine. I'll have to leave it to someone else to figure out why.

TODO: Later I'll add function to the debugging buttons, currently only update have a function. I'll add some option to show a custom console window (that actually worked better that the wx window to show the current parameters status, it had less flicker on frequent updates). I'll also add some custom log file saving option.

Also, the reason I placed Logging.cpp in its own dir is because I plan to add more files to it. There were problems with some build modes, win32 with debugging crashed on booting a game, I don't know if it's my fault. And I could not build Debug win64 because of some wx linking problem.

It adds preliminary support for volume control. I think high delta values (often close to 0x10000) mean that volume should be lowered, and vice versa. But I'm unsure how big the volume steps should be, and where the volume should go to. The current guess is that pb.mixer_control also tell us what the new volume level should be, but I'm not sure about that. The current settings seems to work okay in games like Paper Mario and Fire Emblem when sounds are faded in to begin or faded out to stop. But it worked less well for the sequenced music in Skies of Arcadia where some blocks would get a to high volume.

"d4f8f0d3ae2baf36867ff5863b81dfd541714cc6","2008-10-09 18:47:53+00:00","Added the StretchToFit option to the config menu in the OpenGL plugin. This fixes the blackness in SSBM. I also added a keep aspect ratio option, it will keep your aspect ratio at 4:3, but then SSBM will have the blackness problem again. You find the options under the Enhancements window in the OpenGL configuration.

I also added a wx debugging window for the OpenGL plugin. I connected it to the old console window that was in the plugin. Other than that it doesn't do anything at the moment but it could be useful to show all the current important information and parameter statuses and so on.

Again there's a problem with wx windows collisions.  Show() can't be used because then DLL_PROCESS_DETACH is called immediately after the window is opened, and if we open it with ShowModal() before we have loaded a game the main video window will be blocked. And we can't pass on any variables from a DllDebugger() that is called when Dolphin is started because the dll is reloaded and lose all variables sometime before a game is loaded. So we can't auto open the window that way. So I made the debugging window open as a game is loaded if it is enabled in the ini, the downside is that the ini setting will open the window even if we are not opening Dolphin with the -d flag. However, this will only affect people that have used the debugger at least once so in my opinion this is the most convenient solution. But feel free to come up with a better solution. Preferably some solution to how to use Show() and preventing DLL_PROCESS_DETACH to be called.

When a game used a map file the symbol lookup would make the game crawl to a halt right after booting. This was exaggerated because m_bEnable was true by default, I changed that to off by default so that only selected logging is picked up. I'm guessing the symbol map was disabled earlier because it was slow. I have still kept it enabled but only for the lowest verbosity levels. I also turned off the collected write to the master file, that's not very important however because it doesn't slow the program down very much unless there's thousands of rows per second written. I could probably be on most of the time without much of a speed difference. I'll add an option for it later.

One is generalizing the stwux implementation to all of stXx; not a
particularly significant improvement, but I had it in my tree, and it
makes my WIP JIT a drop-in replacement for the current JIT. (Not that
you'd really want to at the moment... The WIP JIT still has at
least one significant bug I haven't tracked down, and it's a lot slower
for anything using a significant amount of floating-point, which is
basically anything except FMVs.  That said, it should basically work as
long as you're making a 32-bit build.)

The other fix is a minor (but probably visible) performance improvement
for 64-bit Linux: fixing the store JIT to work properly.  I proposed
the patch a couple days ago, but apparently nobody tested it... this
way, I can force everyone on 64-bit Linux to test it :)  Please add the
'NOTE: stb and stbu are broken under 64bit Linux' bit back in if this
breaks anything.

SI devices which are interesting (to me) are GC keyboard, GBA, and N64 devices. Possibly SI.cpp can have the channel part separated out like EXI? Just committing like this to see if this is ok.

should be getting to the point where the performance is reasonably
comparable to the current JIT on most workloads. I'm not sure of the
exact comparisons because I haven't done much in terms of checking the
performance versus the current JIT on floating-point heavy stuff. The
floating point stuff is still relatively unoptimized, and there are still a
few relatively common functions that aren't being compiled yet, but the most
critical work is done.

- Read the function you are changing, there is a default handler, you could should have used it instead or create a new one.

1. Avoided LoadLibrary() and FreeLibrary() in favor of using an existing LoadLibrary() because of an unresolved crash related to LoadLibrary() and nJoy. After several times of LoadLibrary() and FreeLibrary() of nJoy these seems to be some kind of memory corruption that brings up several error boxes from different places (not just nJoy) and then cause a crash.

2. Slowed down the moving of the pad initialization to InputCommon. I'm not against InputCommon at all, but I have to spend some more time with it before it works on Windows

3. Partly fixed a somewhat frequent failure of nJoy with SDL 1.3 that would give a strange DirectInput error message and cause the pads to not function. It's still present before the nJoy config windows is opened. It's only fixed on booting a game.

It's up to GP now. Except for some 2D homebrews which never use GPfifo&CP but direcly XFB. Well, in other words: emulated VSync is uncorrelated with CPU timings now. Tell me if it's too much hacky.

3) Fix XFB address to avoid crash like with Animal Crossing gc. TODO: VI regs need proper typedef and logic.

As I understand it it's primarily used to allow keyboard input at the same time as Dolphin is used. Then it would probably be annoying to send the keyboard input to Dolphin while you are typing. Keyboard inputs was also the main idea with the out of focus option, I think that it's not as important for gamepad input as you are less likely to use the gamepad in two different programs simultaneously.

It also supports third party Wireless Nunchucks that never sends any calibration values. The Nunchuck status should be automatically updated. The Nunchuck stick may get stuck, but that should fix itself if you disconnect and reconnect again. The only important problems seems to be that the real Wiimote fails to answer sometimes so that the Core functions disconnect it.

1) The new ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG _LOG macros were used
ERROR,   // Bad errors - that still don't deserve a PanicAlert.
WARNING, // Something is suspicious.
INFO,    // General information.
DEBUG,   // Strictly for detailed debugging - might make things slow.
2) Made all LOG macro use into some of the logging level supporting macros
LOG is commented out on linux can someone try it on windows? (it's in Log.h)
3) Added ERROR_lOG next to each panic alert

I hope I helped making the logs a bit more useful/readble

This apparently allowed OoT to boot in interpreter mode way back during revisions when multi-executable ISOs wouldn't run past their menus.
This is good since this is one less hack being used, meaning more accurate emulation. It also helps because I don't know if the hack needs to be applied at the same memory location for different regions.

Also update the formatting of these INIs a bit to be more like something the emulator makes today.

This way was suggested by hrydgard in October and I should have listened. A simple pixel shader as hrydgard suggested cannot be used because the alpha is not set if the pixel is discarded due to failing depth (after z texture) or alpha (result of tev stages) tests. There is a bit of a performance hit so there should be an option to disable the second render pass which sets the alpha because it is probably not needed most of the time.

Create a new program called 'DSPTool' which will become a more up to date replacement for gdtool from the devkitpro, automatically incorporating all our findings as we make them. This program depends on the new library. It can *ALMOST* roundtrip (asm->disasm->asm) hermes' DSP mixer at this point. Sorry about the unfinished Sconscript work - I'll fix it soon if nobody else does it first.

Games hang though (probably due to unknown ES call)

-Partially documented Wii DVD cover flags.
-Files opened in Wii Read-Write mode are now set to append.
-Removed annoying overhead-ish 'Idle' log message.

As for /dev/di: Someone clearly didn't know what he was doing in that file. Someone freed memory which didn't belong to that file and then complained about a crash. Needless to say the problem is now solved.

Big TODO on the /dev/di code though, ExecuteCommand is practically doing nothing but reading.

Is there no indication from the game when the screen refresh should occur? No, not what I could find, we currently calculate the refresh rate and m_VBeamPos from the CPU ticks progress. That works perfectly if the CPU and GPU is perfectly synced as in the single core and no-idle skipping mode. So I guess it's possible that the game doesn't indicate when the screen should be refreshed, but rather that the hardware calculate that from the CPU ticks progress. That leaves us with a problem in the dual core and idle skipping modes to calculate a CPU-GPU synced CPU ticks progress.

2. sepia - An attempt at an old-timey sepia tone like in late 1800's video.

I think this is all thats needed to fix problematic games.

This is untested since I don't have Dolphin setup yet :/
Set 'jo.fpAccurateFcmp' to 'false' to test.

p.s. Yes its my first commit, and yes I'm drunk lol

Note to Devs:
The sNaN flag logic isn't implemented yet (and qNaN for fcmpo isn't either); I don't think games are going to be picky about that, but I might implement it later if games are still complaining (when I'm sober... xD)

As tested on Zelda TP, these changes should be able to reduce the number of lines in the compiled pixel shader program by 20% to 30%, for example, from 38 lines to 28 lines after the generated cg/HLSL pixel shader compiled by the cg/HLSL compiler. These could means slightly faster rasterization on slower video cards.

Also fixed shader compilation errors for DX9 plugin by using correct pixel/vertex attribute names that are compatibile with DX9 HLSL shader compiler. Now the generated vertex or pixel shader programs will compile correctly in either OGL or DX9.

However, DX9 plugin is still not fixed, even though the shader programs can be compiled now.

Debugger panel is displayed only if Dolphin is started with /d option.
Dump features are not implemented.
Pause/Resume buttons works, only if the plugin is built in DEBUG or DEBUGFAST configuration, not in RELEASE. These features are really only for devs, not for regular gamers.

You will be able to pause frame by frame, or by n frames, or by n primitive flushes. Other pausing options are not implemented yet.

When other pausing and dumping features are implemented, debugging will be much easier.

I have changed the DX9 project setting to use unicode character set in order to use wxWidge tools. If this causes Dolphin building problems for you, check your project setting.txt

Opengl:
Reorder the rendering path to make it more generic, and a little bit faster i think.
Reduce the index Buffer size to make it more Friendly to older video hardware.
get rid of the remaining annoying sps (I hope).
D3D:
Implement the same path as opengl to make the plugins more similar and maintainable.
Fixed Peek_Z this means, Pushing stars in SMG Now Works.
Please give heavy testing to this changes and compare the performance with the old path.

they are extremely hard/driver Dependant so your test is needed.
there plugin will automatically select the path thats work for your hard, need that everyone post the messages that the video init throw (yes all will hate me for the messages) but is the only way to see what is the optimal path. in the next commit will clean the unused paths.
i'm afraid thath the second path is Vista dependant (you need to include vista sdk to make it work).
the third path use lockable depth buffer so there is no change in that.
now peek color is fully working and is fast because the you never lock the the real color texture only the offscreen surface.
please if someone knows a game that use peek color please test it.
also fixed blending so SMS underwater must be fixed.
this work with d3d teach me that i love opengl :)

corrected a little depth textures still broken but now at least i discover the reason, the ultra bad news for d3d lover is, the only correct way to implement depth textures will be do a firs depth only pass disabling blending.
This is because blending is affecting the values stored in the depth texture, so to store the true values, blending mus be deactivated.
this will degrade performance but is the only 'Correct' way in d3d 9. the other possibility is dx10 but that's a complete different story ;)

first part if fixing, fixed, i thing, the flickering that everyone has reported, at least in my case i only have flickering in the one texture in one game and now is fixed. The other fix is not for an reported issue, is more a correctness fix, running dolphin with pix to review debug errors, result in a ton of warnings and error, now with this commit, at least for ati, there no more error or warnings, this means, correct management and state change, no accurate emulation, for this still a lot of work to do.
for this part of the commit please give me feedback and let me know of remaining issues

Te second part is the partial implementation of efb to ram copy in d3d, this won't brake anything because is commented but i commit this to ask for help from ector and donko in some errors remaining in the implementation related to differences between opengl an d3d.
if you want to test this you have to uncomment line 150 to 155 of bpstruct.cpp

I did this becuse different games may require different directional shake, no need to seperate them to 3 keys I think.

How to: First bind Roll & Pitch to 'Analog 1' or 'Analog 2', then set Roll Degree and Pitch Degree both to: 'Free Swing'.

Now in games, you can swing your emulated wiimote to Up/Down/Left/Right by simply pushing your binding analog stick to Up/Down/Left/Right.

PS:The swing direction will automatically adjust itself when 'Upright Wiimote' option is checked.

Now you can play 'Mad World' with emulated wiimote. :)

in D3D and Opengl:
fixed one nasty bug in texture loading where if a dynamic texture keeps his format but the tlut format is changed, the try or reloading the texture in the same texture could cause a hang if the size of the resulting texture is different than the original (size in bytes)
Applied a ugly temporal hack to the texture conversor to solve efb to ram misalignments and effect distortions.
in D3D:
Pseudo implementation of logic ops using basic blending: the first 8 operations are 'good approximations', the remaining 8 are bullshit :) if someone have a better approximation to emulate this logic please let me know.
please test if i don't break anything in the process and test Mario kart wee you will get a nice surprise.:)

This fixes on WiiMote Button Mapping:
Num /
Num *
Num Decimal
Num Separator
Num Lock
Right Alt -> But on keyboards that have 'Alt Gr' keys it still gonnal report it as Left Ctrl, because when you press it, the OS sends a Left Ctrl then a Alt key...

Also fixes on SimplePad Button Mapping:
Num Decimal
Num Separator
Num Enter
Num Lock
Right Shift
Right Ctrl
Right Alt
Also it now differs Left (Ctrl|Shift|Alt) from the Right ones...

All keys should be working now... I left 'Print Scrn' and 'Pause' out because I don't think those can (or should) be bound...

But if you change the WiiMote source (between Emulated, Real or Inactive) you must disconnect and reconnect (Menu Tools -> Connect WiiMote) the WiiMotes affected by the change...

Thanks to jack.fr0st who did all the emulation state notification work!

Now every plugin has a way to know the current emulation state (paused, stopped or playing)

@ayuanx: I thought about doing a PostMessage(g_WiimoteInitialize.hWnd, WM_USER, WIIMOTE_DISCONNECT, current_number); so that the user gets asked to reconnect that WiiMote, trying to avoid having to disconnect and reconnect, but it didn't work because shooting that message only asks to reconnect, doesn't do a disconnect...

There is still the possibility to override, which can be useful for the very few GC games that do support widescreen.

in videocommon little fix for the alpha test values, return to the original values as they are more accurate.
in D3D:
huge change in state management, now all the state management is centralized and redundant state changes are eliminated.
Fixed the overlapped viewport error in non ati cards:
the error was caused by this: when a viewport is defined larger than the current rendertarget, an error is thrown and the last valid viewport is used, this is the reference behavior, in ati cards if a larger viewport is defined, no eror is returned, the rendering is valid and is rendered using the projection defined by the viewport but limited to the rendertarget are, exactly like opengl or the GC hardware.
to solve this in reference drivers defined a large rendertarget (2x the size of the original) and proceed to render in a centered quad insithe the larger rendertarget, in this way larger viewports always falls inside a valid rendertarget size, the drawback of this is the waste of resources. it can be dynamized, depending or games or changed at runtime when a oversized viewport is detected, but i live that to future commits.
please test this and let me know the results.

in opengl correct an error introduced by mi in efb to ram alignment, it's seems to fix SMS but it missalign a lot of other games, so revert to the default. must solve truncated coins in NSMB.
revert alpha testing values to the values in rev 4812 as they fix some games.
in d3d dynamized the Render target size so it will change at runtime when viewport exceed it size, in the worse case it will cause a missing frame when resizing but in the games I tested is not noticeable at all
This must solve all the remaining viewports problems in nvidia cards, in ati this is not needed.

Advantages:
* Less confusion for users
* No need to build twice to make sure you didn't break something
* Easier to switch between the cores for testing

Disadvantages:
* None, as far as I can tell :) Maybe some extra code complexity, but not much.

Also break some include chains that caused <windows.h> to get included into everything, slowing down the build on Windows. There's more to do here though, there's still a lot of files that get it included that don't need it at all.

Enable the thread by adding this line to the video plugin ini files, 'User\Config\gfx_dx9.ini' and 'User\Config\gfx_opengl.ini':

UseFIFOThread = True

The line should be added under the UseXFB line.

To disable the FIFO thread, use this line:

UseFIFOThread = False

If the line is not in the ini file, the default is disabled (i.e. False).

The FIFO thread causes an error when the OpenGL plugin is used.  The D3D plugin works.

Only top left quarter of the screen can be seen when rendering to main window.  The entire screen can be viewed when running in a window.

first fixed scaling when updating backbuffer to make it friendly with encoders, now frame dumping must work without errors in any codec.
clean screenshot and frame dumping code now is more correct, faster and stable.
improve safe texture cache, improving the distribution of the hash algorithm, including tlut hash in the final hash of the texture, and making use of a 64 bit hash to make it more accurate.
clean a lot of code and corrected some missused vertex formats when drawing full screen quads.
and biggest change last:
implemented pseudo antialiasing: a image post-process algorithm that mimics antialiazing and is fare more easier to implement in this scenario.
you can change the intensity of the effect changing the values of the antialiasing combo. the right value depends on the game.
for example mkwii looks awesome with 8x.
please try all the changes and let me know the results.
if something is broken, please let me know and will fix it asap.

3 modes implemented:
2x = is a one and a half samples supersampled buffer with a linear texture fetch, this produce a similar result of a 2x MSAA
4x = four samples with a aligned texture fetch in the center of the 4 samples, this produce a little best effect that the first mode.
8x = is a four samples with a  rotated grid fetching producing a nicer (really nicer in some cases) antialiasing.

Hopefully this removes some of the overhead from the X event loops.  One downside is that the IR emulation will not work until another event on the window has occured.  Although this is minor, usually an event happens before you need the IR pointer.

Removed X event loops from GCPad and Wiimote plugins, and implemented an asynchronous check for keyboard and mouse buttons.
Also added an X event loop in core that handles events while the emulator is paused.  Prevents unexpected behavior from events that occur while the emulator is paused.
Now there is only one event loop running at a time (besides those hidden in SDL).
I will revert this commit if other devs are unhappy with it.

fixed a misbehavior in the clear code that causes depth clear problems in reference hardware (Intel as example).
add 6 parameters to optimize Safe Texture Cache:
SafeTextureCacheColorSamples, SafeTextureCacheIndexedSamples, SafeTextureCacheTlutSamples:

this 3 parameters gives the number of samples taken to calculate the final hash value, less samples = more speed, more samples = more accuracy
if 0 is specified the hash is calculated using all the data in the texture.
SafeTextureCacheColorMaxSize, SafeTextureCacheIndexedMaxSize, SafeTextureCacheTlutMaxSize:
this parameters limits the amount of data used for the hash calculation, it could appear as redundant but in some games is better to make a full hash of the first bytes instead of some samples of all the texture.

color, indexed, tlut : define the texture type, full color data, indexed, and the tlut memory.

the parameters are available in the config , no GUI at this time, if the test are OK will add it to the GUI.
if someone needs it will give more examples on how to configure the values for specific games.

after some test the more relevant parameters were the color samples and the tlut max size.
so delete the rest of the parameters and define 3 modes:
Safe : the two values are set to 0 meaning all the texture data and all the tlut data are hashed this is the most correct and slowwwwwwwwwww way
Normal: 37 samples are taken from the color textures an the firs 4096 bytes of the tlut are hashed, is a lot faster than safe mode but in some games i observe small glitches.
Fast: 8 samples are taken from the color textures an the first 1024 bytes are hashed from the tlut, is a little slower than the unsafe cache but at least all the games i tested have correct text output and fast frame rate. the glitches in dinamyc color textures are more noticeable in this mode
this values could be improved, if you find a better combination please post it and the game it fixes and i will update the source.
for the moment, as my time is limited by a lot of work, only implemented the d3d gui, if someone can implement the opengl gui will be a lot of help for me.
please test a lot and let me know the results.
