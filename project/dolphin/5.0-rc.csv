It changes the string in the Android backend select to just OpenGL ES.
Adds a check in the Android code to check for Tegra 4 and to enable the option to select the OpenGL ES backend.
Adds a DriverDetails bug under BUG_ISTEGRA as a blanket case of Tegra 4 support.
The changes that effects most lines in this change. Removing all float suffixes in the pixel/vertex/util shaders since OpenGL ES 2 doesn't support float suffixes.
Disables the shaders for reinterpreting the EFB format since Tegra 4 doesn't support integers.
Changes GLFunctions.cpp to grab the correct Tegra extension functions.
Readds the GLSL 1.2 'hacks' as GLSLES2 'hacks' since they are required for GLSL ES 2
Adds a GLSLES2 to the GLSL_VERSION enum.
Disable the SamplerCache on Tegra since Tegra doesn't support samplers...
Enable glBufferSubData on Tegra since it is the only mobile GPU to correctly work with it.
Disable glDrawRangeElements on Tegra since it doesn't support it, This uses glDrawElements instead.

Turns out Android devs decided to opt for one of the most retarded ways of handling assets. Assets with some specific extensions are not compressed (png, jpeg, etc), and anything else is compressed. The AssetManager is so revolutionary, that you actually can't retrieve valid FileChannel descriptors from these compressed files! To add to this revolutionary system, they actually didn't give you a straightforward way of disabling this compression. Now using FileChannels are not possible, and thus we must use the much slower way of copying everything over. Thank you Android devs. Godforbid someone would like to use a non-array based way of copying things that's actually efficient, considering DMA access is possible with FileChannels.

* Currently there is no DEBUGFAST configuration. Defining DEBUGFAST as a preprocessor definition in Base.props (or a global header) enables it for now, pending a better method. This was done to make managing the build harder to screw up. However it may not even be an issue anymore with the new .props usage.
* D3DX11SaveTextureToFile usage is dropped and not replaced.
* If you have $(DXSDK_DIR) in your global property sheets (Microsoft.Cpp.$(PlatformName).user), you need to remove it. The build will error out with a message if it's configured incorrectly.
* If you are on Windows 8 or above, you no longer need the June 2010 DirectX SDK installed to build dolphin. If you are in this situation, it is still required if you want your built binaries to be able to use XAudio2 and XInput on previous Windows versions.
* GLew updated to 1.10.0
* compiler switches added: /volatile:iso, /d2Zi+
* LTCG available via msbuild property: DolphinRelease
* SDL updated to 2.0.0
* All Externals (excl. OpenAL and SDL) are built from source.
* Now uses STL version of std::{mutex,condition_variable,thread}
* Now uses Build as root directory for *all* intermediate files
* Binary directory is populated as post-build msbuild action
* .gitignore is simplified
* UnitTests project is no longer compiled

is just stupid. Now we copy the complete texture into a pbo and readback this
at once. So we don't have to wait for lots of round-trip-times.

imo DolphinWX still isn't the best place for this, but now it's in the same file as all other hotkeys. Maybe they'll be moved to InputCommon sometimes at once ...

MemArena mmaps the emulated memory from a file in order to get the same
mapping at multiple addresses.  A file which, formerly, was located at a
static filename: it was unlinked after creation, but the open did not
use O_EXCL, so if two instances started up on the same system at just
the right time, they would get the same memory.  Naturally, this caused
extremely mysterious crashes, but only in Netplay, where the game is
automatically started when the client receives a broadcast from the
server, so races are actually quite likely.

And switch to shm_open, because it fits the bill better and avoids any
issues with using /tmp.

OpenCL was originally added to the Dolphin codebase 1 month after it was released with OS X Snow Leopard in 2009. OpenCL was one of the largest group projects that Dolphin ever has had. The OpenCL texture decoder was originally aded with version 1.0 of the OpenCL spec; This version didn't have the capability of a OpenCL-OpenGL interop which would allow for uploading textures once and have it decoded directly to a OpenGL texure. This was to be worked out when the OpenCL 1.1 spec was released and allowed the interop. This work has never been done, and no one in the team is willing to work on it for various reasons. OpenCL has had the unreasonable expectation that it increases the performance of video games that require a large amount of EFB copies like NSMBW. In reality, enabling OpenCL just put the graphics card in a higher power mode which increased the game speed. This is due to the unfortunate effect of Dolphin tending to not push GPUs out of their lower frequency power savings modes. Thanks to everyone that had contributed to the OpenCL texture decoder.

Let's talk a bit about this bug. 12nd oldest bug not fixed in Dolphin, it was a
lot of fun to debug and it kept me busy for a while :)

Shoutout to Nintendo for framework.map, without which this could have taken a
lot longer.

Basic debugging using apitrace shows that the heat effect is rendered in an
interesting way:
* An EFB copy texture is created, using the hardware scaler to divide the
texture resolution by two and that way create the blur effect.
* This texture is then warped using indirect texturing: a deformation map is
used to 'move' the texture coordinates used to sample the framebuffer copy.

Pixel shader: http://pastie.org/private/25oe1pqn6s0h5yieks1jfw

Interestingly, when looking at apitrace, the deformation texture was only 4x4
pixels... weird. It also does not have any feature that you would expect from a
deformation map. Seeing how the heat effect glitches, this deformation texture
being wrong looks like a good candidate for the problem. Let's see how it's
loaded!

By NOPing random calls to GXSetTevIndirect, we find a call that when removed
breaks the effect completely. The parameters used for this call come from the
results of methods of JPAExTexShapeArc objects. 3 different objects go through
this code path, by breaking each one we can notice that the one 'controlling'
the heat effect is the one at 0x81575b98.

Following the path of this object a bit more, we can see that it has a method
called 'getIndTexId'. When this is called, the returned texture ID is used to
index a map and get a JPATextureArc object stored at 0x81577bec.

Nice feature of JPATextureArc: they have a getName method. For this object, it
returns 'AK_kagerouInd01'. We can probably use that to see how this texture
should look like, by loading it 'manually' from the Wind Waker DVD.
Unfortunately I don't know how to do that. Fortunately @Abahbob got me the
texture I wanted in less than 10min after I asked him on Twitter.
AK_kagerouInd01 is a 32x32 texture that really looks like a deformation map:
http://i.imgur.com/0TfZEVj.png . Fun fact: 'kagerou' means 'heat haze' in JP.

So apparently we're not using the right texture object when rendering! The
GXTexObj that maps to the JPATextureArc is at offset 0x81577bf0 and points to
data at 0x80ed0460, but we're loading texture data from 0x0039d860 instead.

I started to suspect the BP write that loads the texture parameters 'did not
work' somehow. Logged that and yes: nothing gets loaded to texture stage 1! ...
but it turns out this is normal, the deformation map is loaded to texture stage
5 (hardcoded in the DOL). Wait, why is the TextureCache trying to load from
texture stage 1 then?!

Because someone sucked at hex.

Some information on this bug since this isn't quite true.
Seemingly with the v53 driver, Qualcomm has actually fixed this bug. So we can dynamically access UBO array members.
The issue that is cropping up is actually converting our attribute 'fposmtx' to an integer.
int posmtx = int(fpostmtx);
This line causes some seemingly garbage values to enter in to the posmtx variable.
Not sure exactly why it is failing, probably them just not actually converting the float to an integer and just handling the float directly as a integer.
So the bug is going to stay active with Qualcomm devices until we convert this vertex attribute from a float to a integer.

Also as we flush on primitive switch, we don't have to create three different index buffers. All indices are now stored in one buffer.

This will slow down games which switch often primitive types (eg ztp), but it should be more accurate.

This branch is the final step of fully supporting both OpenGL and OpenGL ES in the same binary.
This of course only applies to EGL and won't work for GLX/AGL/WGL since they don't really support GL ES.
The changes here actually aren't too terrible, basically change every #ifdef USE_GLES to a runtime check.

This adds a DetectMode() function to the EGL context backend.
EGL will iterate through each of the configs and check for GL, GLES3_KHR, and GLES2 bits
After that it'll change the mode from _DETECT to whichever one is the best supported.
After that point we'll just create a context with the mode that was detected

- Properly retrieve all of the contexts in the EGL initialization in EGLHelper.java.
- Remove the attribute EGL_RENDERABLE_TYPE from the pbuffersurface attributes in EGLHelper.java. With this present, the EGL context will always fail to reinitialize if destroyed and attempted to be recreated.
- Break the inner class Limit within GLES2InfoFragment.java, GLES3InfoFragment.java, and GLInfoFragment.java into its own single class. Greatly reduces code duplication.
- Introduce a Type enum into Limit.java (one of the wildly rare cases in Java where an enum is actually an OK solution). Removes duplicated constants from the Java files stated in the previous bullet note.
- Add a copyright comment to the top of EGLHelper.java. Forgot to do this initially, my bad.
- Add some missing override annotations to GLES2InfoFragment.java, GLES3InfoFragment.java, and GLInfoFragment.java.
- Use StringBuilders in the previously mentioned three Java files. This is better than using a String in this instance, as the String object won't have to be recreated multiple times (ala concatenation).

- Added the 'final' modifier to the above three classes and to Limit.java. These classes serve a single purpose only, and are not intended to be inherited.

OSX has their own driver, so performance issues aren't shared with the nvidia driver (unlike the closed source linux and windows nvidia driver). So now they'll also use the MapAndSync backend like all other osx drivers.

fixes issue 6596

I've also cleaned up the if/else block selecting the best backend a bit.

On Windows, nvidia don't give us their driver version, so we can't workaround any issues.
As buffer_storage is broken on some drivers, we wanted to disble it for them.
So we can't.

Luckyly only 'some' released driver versions are affected as this extension is only available since some months. Let's hope that nobody have to use one of this driver version, else they will get a black screen ...

Floating-point is complicated...

Some background: Denormals are floats that are too close to zero to be
stored in a normalized way (their exponent would need more bits). Since
they are stored unnormalized, they are hard to work with, even in
hardware.  That's why both PowerPC and SSE can be configured to operate
in faster but non-standard-conpliant modes in which these numbers are
simply rounded ('flushed') to zero.

Internally, we do the same as the PowerPC CPU and store all floats in
double format. This means that for loading and storing singles we need a
conversion. The PowerPC CPU does this in hardware. We previously did
this using CVTSS2SD/CVTSD2SS. Unfortunately, these instructions are
considered arithmetic and therefore flush denormals to zero if non-IEEE
mode is active. This normally wouldn't be a problem since the next
arithmetic floating-point instruction would do the same anyway but as it
turns out some games actually use floating-point instructions for
copying arbitrary data.

My idea for fixing this problem was to use x87 instructions since the
x87 FPU never supported flush-to-zero and thus doesn't mangle denormals.
However, there is one more problem to deal with: SNaNs are automatically
converted to QNaNs (by setting the most-significant bit of the
fraction). I opted to fix this by manually resetting the QNaN bit of all
values with all-1s exponent.

4. Implement JIT optimizations for MMIO accesses.

This looks more natural and the offset should be masked anyway.

Some compilers we care about (mostly g++) do not support std::make_unique yet,
but we still want to use it in our codebase to make unique_ptr code more
readable. This commit introduces an implementation derivated from the libc++
code in the Dolphin codebase so we can use it right now everywhere.

The clean theme was a little rushed. There was barely over a week between it's start date and the 4.0 release, and there was school and other crazy going on at the time. Having lived with the clean theme for a while, the weaknesses of the theme was really beginning to irritate me. So I've taken my time and worked on them over the past few months, and used them day to day to get the feel of them. The result is much better overall - everything has been tweaked from the ground up!

While there is a 'full' changelog below, the primary change is a transitions from a gradient + dropshadow (and sometimes etch, don't think about it too hard) to a gradient + etch style. It's the same icons and the same style just, dare I say, cleaner? It's also much more variation friendly, allowing consistant results across all the colors and sizes. It pays off big time; everything that isn't default is drastically improved. For those that just use default, it's still better, thanks to the higher quality.

In my view, this is the completed clean theme.

Changlog:

*No dropshadow - gives the theme a even cleaner look and greatly improves the colored and @2x versions
*Improved etch effect with subtle variations as needed to each icon for best results
*New GameCube Icon - accurate to hardware, matches the accurate wiimote-nunchuk
*Tweaked gradients for a slightly flatter look
*Redone Lite theme. Still weird on light chrome, but awesome on dark chrome. Has a sort of white iPod look.
*@2x icons take better advantage of the higher resolution while still matching
*Improved the open icon's 'disc', with precise angles on the reflection and mouseover awesome
*Removed slight curve from the Play icon
*Graphics icon now has a 'power light' that no one will ever notice if they don't read this.
*And an obscene amount of tweaks way too small to include here

DeviceUpdate() now works independently of Update(): it's now just a periodic

replies are popped off the queue much more aggressively.

This isn't technically the correct place to have the downcount variable, but it is similar to what PPSSPP does to gain a bit of extra speed on ARM.
We access this variable quite a bit, with each exit in a block it is subtracted from.
On ARM this required four instructions to load and store the value, while now it only requires two.

This gives an average of 1FPS gain to most games.
Examples:
Crazy Taxi: 54FPS -> 55FPS
Luigi's Mansion: 20FPS -> 21FPS
Wind Waker(Save Screen): 27FPS -> 28FPS

This seems to average a 6mhz to 16mhz CPU core emulation improvement in the few games I've tested.

This reverts commit ff918df88991710d58d983aa2e5dbcf03f2064ab.

This changed it from 'RendererHasFocus' to 'UIHasFocus', which is
wrong. Specifically, it broke for non-Render to Main Window cases where
the renderer window isn't managed by wx. It also broke the pending
exclusive fullscreen support, which checks this function to determine if
the renderer is on top so it can full-screen it.

We'll add a new hook, 'UIHasFocus', in the next commit.

PowerPC has a 32 bit CR register, which is used to store flags for results of
computations. Most instructions have an optional bit that tells the CPU whether
the flags should be updated. This 32 bit register actually contains 8 sets of 4
flags: Summary Overflow (SO), Equals (EQ), Greater Than (GT), Less Than (LT).
These 8 sets are usually called CR0-CR7 and accessed independently. In the most
common operations, the flags are computed from the result of the operation in
the following fashion:
* EQ is set iff result == 0
* LT is set iff result < 0
* GT is set iff result > 0
* (Dolphin does not emulate SO)

While X86 architectures have a similar concept of flags, it is very difficult
to access the FLAGS register directly to translate its value to an equivalent
PowerPC value. With the current Dolphin implementation, updating a PPC CR
register requires CPU branching, which has a few performance issues: it uses
space in the BTB, and in the worst case (!GT, !LT, EQ) requires 2 branches not
taken.

After some brainstorming on IRC about how this could be improved, calc84maniac
figured out a neat trick that makes common CR operations way more efficient to
JIT on 64 bit X86 architectures. It relies on emulating each CRn bitfield with
a 64 bit register internally, whose value is the result of the operation from
which flags are updated, sign extended to 64 bits. Then, checking if a CR bit
is set can be done in the following way:
* EQ is set iff LOWER_32_BITS(cr_64b_val) == 0
* GT is set iff (s64)cr_64b_val > 0
* LT is set iff bit 62 of cr_64b_val is set

To take a few examples, if the result of an operation is:
* -1 (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF) -> lower 32 bits not 0       => !EQ
-> (s64)val (-1) is not > 0  => !GT
-> bit 62 is set             =>  LT
!EQ, !GT, LT

*  0 (0x0000000000000000) -> lower 32 bits are 0       =>  EQ
-> (s64)val (0) is not > 0   => !GT
-> bit 62 is not set         => !LT
EQ, !GT, !LT

*  1 (0x0000000000000001) -> lower 32 bits not 0       => !EQ
-> (s64)val (1) is > 0       =>  GT
-> bit 62 is not set         => !LT
!EQ, GT, !LT

Sometimes we need to convert PPC CR values to these 64 bit values. The
following convention is used in this case:
* Bit 0 (LSB) is set iff !EQ
* Bit 62 is set iff LT
* Bit 63 is set iff !GT
* Bit 32 always set to disambiguize between EQ and GT

Some more examples:
* !EQ, GT, LT -> 0x4000000100000001 (!B63, B62, B32, B0)
-> lower 32 bits not 0          => !EQ
-> (s64)val is > 0              =>  GT
-> bit 62 is set                =>  LT
* EQ, GT, !LT -> 0x0000000100000000
-> lower 32 bits are 0          =>  EQ
-> (s64)val is > 0 (note: B32)  =>  GT
-> bit 62 is not set            => !LT

When AIDMA begins, the first thing it does is load the source address

Some begin the AIDMA process without all the data necessary for the
interrupt callback being set up already - they require a few more cycles
to set it up (the delay between the DMA being set to begin and the
interrupt firing). The value of this delay was approximated by tests on real
hardware.

Thanks to magumagu's softfp experiments, we know a lot more about the Wii's
strange floating point unit than we used to. In particular, when doing a
single-precision floating point multiply (fmulsx), it rounds the right hand
side's mantissa so as to lose the low 28 bits (of the 53-bit mantissa).

Emulating this behavior in Dolphin fixes a bunch of issues with games that
require extremely precise emulation of floating point hardware, especially
game replays. Fortunately, we can do this with rather little CPU cost; just ~5
extra instructions per multiply, instead of the vast load of a pure-software
float implementation.

This doesn't make floating-point behavior at all perfect. I still suspect
fmadd rounding might not be quite right, since the Wii uses fused instructions
and Dolphin doesn't, and NaN/infinity/exception handling is probably off in
various ways... but it's definitely way better than before.

This appears to fix replays in Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart Double Dash, and
Super Smash Brothers Brawl. I wouldn't be surprised if it fixes a bunch of
other stuff too.

The changes to instructions other than fmulsx may not be strictly necessary,
but I included them for completeness, since it feels wrong to fix some
instructions but not others, since some games we didn't test might rely on
them.

Possible performance implications: efbAccessReady now uses an Event
rather than spinning, which might be slightly slower, but considering
the slow loop the flags are being checked in from the GPU thread, I
doubt it's noticeable.

Also, this uses sequentially consistent rather than release/acquire
memory order, which might be slightly slower, especially on ARM...
something to improve in Event/Flag, really.

Separated out from my gpu-determinism branch by request.  It's not a big
commit; I just like to write long commit messages.

The main reason to kill it is hopefully a slight performance improvement
from avoiding the double switch (especially in single core mode);
however, this also improves cycle calculation, as described below.

- FifoCommandRunnable is removed; in its stead, Decode returns the
number of cycles (which only matters for 'sync' GPU mode), or 0 if there
was not enough data, and is also responsible for unknown opcode alerts.

Decode and DecodeSemiNop are almost identical, so the latter is replaced
with a skipped_frame parameter to Decode.  Doesn't mean we can't improve
skipped_frame mode to do less work; if, at such a point, branching on it
has too much overhead (it certainly won't now), it can always be changed
to a template parameter.

- FifoCommandRunnable used a fixed, large cycle count for display lists,
regardless of the contents.  Presumably the actual hardware's processing
time is mostly the processing time of whatever commands are in the list,
and with this change InterpretDisplayList can just return the list's
cycle count to be added to the total.  (Since the calculation for this
is part of Decode, it didn't seem easy to split this change up.)

To facilitate this, Decode also gains an explicit 'end' parameter in
lieu of FifoCommandRunnable's call to GetVideoBufferEndPtr, which can
point to there or to the end of a display list (or elsewhere in
gpu-determinism, but that's another story).  Also, as a small
optimization, InterpretDisplayList now calls OpcodeDecoder_Run rather
than having its own Decode loop, to allow Decode to be inlined (haven't
checked whether this actually happens though).

skipped_frame mode still does not traverse display lists and uses the
old fake value of 45 cycles.  degasus has suggested that this hack is
not essential for performance and can be removed, but I want to separate
any potential performance impact of that from this commit.

fix any issues, but it's more correct and a nearly-free improvement.

I excluded this option from the config file. This stopped the check box value and the boolean from becoming offset. Since the option should always start as false.

This still causes an issue with the Wiimote input, since the class variable that keeps the state will be wiped, but the check box value will stay the same after closing/reopening without closing the entire Wiimote configuration. I am looking for a way to resolve this.

I also reduced wait time to 2.5 seconds vs. the 5  seconds previously. Seemed to be a little long.

These changes apparently did not go through.

The register is RBP, previously in the GPR allocation order.  The next
commit will investigate whether there are too few GPRs (now or before),
but for now there is no replacement.

Previously, it was accessed RIP relatively; using RBP, anything in the
first 0x100 bytes of ppcState (including all the GPRs) can be accessed
with three fewer bytes.  Code to access ppcState is generated constantly
(mostly by register save/load), so in principle, this should improve
instruction cache footprint significantly.  It seems that this makes a
significant performance difference in practice.

The vast majority of this commit is mechanically replacing
M(&PowerPC::ppcState.x) with a new macro PPCSTATE(x).

Version 2: gets most of the cases which were using the register access
macros.

Rather than using a variety of registers including RSI, ABI_PARAM1
(either RCX or RDI), RCX, and RDX, the rule is:

- RDI and RSI are never used.  This allows them to be allocated on Unix,
bringing parity with Windows.

- RDX is a permanent temporary register along with RAX (and is thus not
FlushLocked).  It's used frequently enough that allocating it would
probably be a bad idea, as it would constantly get flushed.

- RCX is allocatable, but is flushed in two situations:
- Non-immediate shifts (rlwnm), because x86 requires RCX to be used.
- Paired single loads and stores, because they require three
temporary registers: the helper functions take two integer
arguments, and another register is used as an index to get the
function address.
These should be relatively rare.

While we're at it, in stores, use the registers directly where possible
rather than always using temporaries (by making SafeWriteRegToReg
clobber less).  The address doesn't need to be clobbered in the usual
case, and on CPUs with MOVBE, neither does the value.

Oh, and get rid of a useless MEMCHECK.

This commit does not actually add new registers to the allocation order;
it is intended to test for any performance or correctness issues
separately.

In theory this allows the assignments to be modified easily.  I verified

This is a cleanup of the gameini database. Specifically:
It removes the 'Issues=...' lines and their respective comments since
they don't show up in the gui, are very old and wrong in most cases.
They contain probably more than 4 year old comments (i don't have a clue
who or when wrote them).
Also remove the 'EFBCopyCacheEnable = True' lines from the database.
These were put at a time that efb to Ram had resolution issues without
cache being enabled, safe texture cache could be disabled and speed was
detrimental. Now that efb to ram doesn't have the same res issues as
back then, safe texture cache can't be disabled with speed gains being
non existent (you get even a speed hit if texture cache is put to safe)
i think it should be removed from the database.

and allow multiple passes.

12% faster overall in Pokemon Puzzle; probably less in typical games (Virtual
Console games seem to be carry-heavy for some reason; maybe a different
compiler?)

This should dramatically reduce code size in the case of blocks with
lots of branches, and certainly doesn't hurt elsewhere either.

This can probably be improved a good bit through smarter tracking of register
usage, e.g. discarding registers that are going to be overwritten, but this
is a good start and should help reduce code size and register pressure.
Unlike that sort of change, this is a 'safe' patch; it only flushes registers,
which can't affect correctness, unlike actually discarding data.

As part of this, refactor PPCAnalyst to support distinguishing between
float and integer registers (to properly handle instructions that access
both, like floating-point loads and stores).

Also update every instruction in the interpreter flags table I could find
that didn't have all the correct flags.

It's a relatively big commit (less big with -w), but it's hard to test
any of this separately...

The basic problem is that in netplay or movies, the state of the CPU
must be deterministic, including when the game receives notification
that the GPU has processed FIFO data.  Dual core mode notifies the game
whenever the GPU thread actually gets around to doing the work, so it
isn't deterministic.  Single core mode is because it notifies the game
'instantly' (after processing the data synchronously), but it's too slow
for many systems and games.

My old dc-netplay branch worked as follows: everything worked as normal
except the state of the CP registers was a lie, and the CPU thread only
delivered results when idle detection triggered (waiting for the GPU if
they weren't ready at that point).  Usually, a game is idle iff all the
work for the frame has been done, except for a small amount of work
depending on the GPU result, so neither the CPU or the GPU waiting on
the other affected performance much.  However, it's possible that the
game could be waiting for some earlier interrupt, and any of several
games which, for whatever reason, never went into a detectable idle
(even when I tried to improve the detection) would never receive results
at all.  (The current method should have better compatibility, but it
also has slightly higher overhead and breaks some other things, so I
want to reimplement this, hopefully with less impact on the code, in the
future.)

With this commit, the basic idea is that the CPU thread acts as if the
work has been done instantly, like single core mode, but actually hands
it off asynchronously to the GPU thread (after backing up some data that
the game might change in memory before it's actually done).  Since the
work isn't done, any feedback from the GPU to the CPU, such as real
XFB/EFB copies (virtual are OK), EFB pokes, performance queries, etc. is
broken; but most games work with these options disabled, and there is no
need to try to detect what the CPU thread is doing.

Technically: when the flag g_use_deterministic_gpu_thread (currently
stuck on) is on, the CPU thread calls RunGpu like in single core mode.
This function synchronously copies the data from the FIFO to the
internal video buffer and updates the CP registers, interrupts, etc.
However, instead of the regular ReadDataFromFifo followed by running the
opcode decoder, it runs ReadDataFromFifoOnCPU ->
OpcodeDecoder_Preprocess, which relatively quickly scans through the
FIFO data, detects SetFinish calls etc., which are immediately fired,
and saves certain associated data from memory (e.g. display lists) in
AuxBuffers (a parallel stream to the main FIFO, which is a bit slow at
the moment), before handing the data off to the GPU thread to actually
render.  That makes up the bulk of this commit.

In various circumstances, including the aforementioned EFB pokes and
performance queries as well as swap requests (i.e. the end of a frame -
we don't want the CPU potentially pumping out frames too quickly and the
GPU falling behind*), SyncGPU is called to wait for actual completion.

The overhead mainly comes from OpcodeDecoder_Preprocess (which is,
again, synchronous), as well as the actual copying.

Currently, display lists and such are escrowed from main memory even
though they usually won't change over the course of a frame, and
textures are not even though they might, resulting in a small chance of
graphical glitches.  When the texture locking (i.e. fault on write) code
lands, I can make this all correct and maybe a little faster.

* This suggests an alternate determinism method of just delaying results
until a short time before the end of each frame.  For all I know this
might mostly work - I haven't tried it - but if any significant work
hinges on the competion of render to texture etc., the frame will be
missed.

It now affects the GPU determinism mode as well as some miscellaneous
things that were calling IsNetPlayRunning.  Probably incomplete.

Notably, this can change while paused, if the user starts recording a
movie.  The movie code appears to have been missing locking between
setting g_playMode and doing other things, which probably had a small
chance of causing crashes or even desynced movies; fix that with
PauseAndLock.

The next commit will add a hidden config variable to override GPU
determinism mode.

This was a subtle bug I introduced since I removed a LDR in one of the ComputeCarry functions.
Basically since I wasn't loading the XER value prior to operations when I did a BIC tmp, tmp, 1 it would clear the first bit in our temp register but
retain the rest of the 'random' data from that temp register. This would then save in to xer_ca, which the Interpreter will use later without any
masking to generate the XER value. Our XER generation helper functions don't do any masking since they were only expecting a single bit worth of data
in xer_ca with the rest being zero.
So now we only have one bit of data being stored in xer_ca from the ARMv7 JIT recompiler, and also a slight optimization in the ComputeCarry function
that is used on the immediate path. There wasn't any reason to load xer_ca since it only contains one bit of data now.

This is good hygiene, and also happens to be required to build Dolphin
using Clang modules.

(Under this setup, each header file becomes a module, and each #include

still leak through (by default), but modules are compiled independently,
and can't depend on defines or types having previously been set up.  The
main reason to retrofit it onto Dolphin is compilation performance - no

This particular bug from our friends over at Qualcomm manifests itself due to our alpha testing code having a conditional if statement in it.
This is a fairly recent breakage this time around, it was introduced in the v95 driver which comes with Android 5.0 on the Nexus 5.

So to break this issue down; In our alpha testing code we have two comparisons that happen and if they are true we will continue rendering, but if
they aren't true we do an early discard and return. This is summed up with a fairly simple if statement.

if (!(condition_1 <logic op> condition_2)) { /* discard and return */ }

This particular issue isn't actually due to the conditions within the if statement, but the negation of the result. This is the particular issue that
causes Qualcomm to fall flat on its face while doing so.

I've got two simple test cases that demonstrate this.
Non-working: http://hastebin.com/evugohixov.avrasm
Working: http://hastebin.com/afimesuwen.avrasm

As one can see, the disassembled output between the two shaders is different even though in reality it should have the same visual result.

I'm currently writing up a simple test program for Qualcomm to enjoy, since they will be asking for one when I tell them about the bug.
It will be tracked in our video driver failure spreadsheet along with the others.

This is pretty much a step backwards in our code. We used to use attributes in our PP shader system a long time ago but we changed it to attributeless
for code simplicity and cleanliness. This reimplements the attribute code path as an optional path to take in the case your system doesn't work with
attributeless rendering. In this case the only shipping drivers that we can know for sure supports attributeless rendering is the Nexus 5's v95 driver
that is included in the Android 5.0 image.

I hadn't planned on implementing a work around to get post processing working in these cases, but due to us force enabling the PP shader system at all
times it sort of went up on the priority list. We can't be having a supported platform black screening at all times can we?

- Get rid of ArmMemTools.cpp and rename x64MemTools.cpp to MemTools.cpp.
ArmMemTools was almost identical to the POSIX part of x64MemTools, and
the two differences, (a) lack of sigaltstack, which I added to the
latter recently, and (b) use of r10 to determine the fault address
instead of info->si_addr (meaning it only works for specifically
formatted JIT code), I don't think are necessary.  (Plus Android, see
below.)

- Rename Core/PowerPC/JitCommon/JitBackpatch.h to Core/MachineContext.h.
It doesn't contain anything JIT-specific anymore, and e.g. locking
will want to use faulting support regardless of whether any JIT is in
use.

- Get rid of different definitions of SContext for different
architectures under __linux__, since this is POSIX.  The exception is
of course Android being shitty; I moved the workaround definition from
ArmMemTools.cpp to here.

- Get rid of #ifdefs around EMM::InstallExceptionHandler and just
provide an empty implementation for unsupported systems (i.e.
_M_GENERIC really).  Added const bool g_exception_handlers_supported
for future use; currently exception handlers are only used by the JIT,
whose use implies non-M_GENERIC, but locking will change that.

- Remove an unnecessary typedef.

caused the code to only free the arena if the first byte was non-zero.

When we cleaned up the code to calculate the shm_position and total_mem
in one step, we sometimes skipped over certain views because they were
Wii-only. When looking at the total memory, we'd look at the last field,
whether or not it was skipped. Since Wii-only fields are the last view,
this meant that the shm_position was 0, since it was skipped, causing us
to map a 0-sized field. Fix this by explicitly returning the total size
from MemoryMap_InitializeViews.

Additionally, the shm_position was being calculated incorrectly because
it was adding up the shm_position *before* the mirror, rather than after
it. Fix this by adopting a scheme similar to what we had before.

This was interesting implementing.
Our generic QueryPerformanceCounter function on ARMv7 was so slow that profiling a block was impossible.
I waited about five minutes and I couldn't even get a single frame to output.
This instead uses ARMv7's PMU to get cycle counts, which are a relatively minor performance drop in my testing.
One disadvantage of this method is that the kernel can lock us out of using these co-processor registers, but it seems to work on my Jetson board.
Another disadvantage is that we aren't having block times in 'real' time but cycles instead, not too big of a deal.

This also removes instruction run counts from profiling because that's just annoying and we don't expose an interface for even getting those results
from our UI.

This wasn't too much of a concern since we normally don't care about this feature set, but it is nice when testing on new devices and they don't
support the higher feature sets but want to run under software renderer.

The Mesa softpipe and PowerVR 5xx drivers don't support higher GL versions, but they shouldn't exit out just because they couldn't get a GL3 function

There was a longstanding hack that defined ucontext_t manually to work
around the lack of this header on the Android NDK.  However, it looks
like newer NDK versions now have it like good little POSIX boys, and my
recent header reshuffle broke the build on those versions, presumably
because the real and fake definitions of ucontext_t end up included in
the same file where they weren't under the old organization.

Rather than try to revert the conflict, this commit just removes the
hack.  The buildbot's NDK will need to be upgraded.

Fifo overflow fix

The idea behind separating the CPU and GPU thread path is to prevent two threads executing the same function (SetCPStatusFromCPU) at the same time. The CPU thread gets to that function via GetherPipeBursted and the GPU thread gets there via SetCPStatusFromGPU. I wrote the original (factored) version as I like to keep code duplication to a minimum. This worked most of the time but not all of the time. It was a good move to separate it to a GPU version and a CPU version, but then the GPU version called the CPU version at the tail end. Removing the call (as in this PR) prevents the FIFO overflow in Starfox Adventures.

The 'Updating the CPStatus before FIFO events' change is simply there to keep the DC code path and the SC code path consistent in the !GPLinked scenario. The SC code path does the same thing when !GPLinked via RunGPU. Putting the SetCPStatus call before the !GPLinked state changes the DC code path to do the same thing. The more we keep the DC and SC code paths consistent, the better.

Forcing the exception check on interrupts is the change for The Last Story. It makes the emulator process interrupts more responsively on CP interrupts.

The HiWatermark check is something that old (pre-2010) versions of Dolphin used to do. Games like Battalion Wars 2 do not expect the GPU to run so slowly and do not have the code to react to that situation, so this change makes the emulator extra careful in those situations.

This is a fairly lengthy change that can't be separated out to multiple commits well due to the nature of fastmem being a bit of an intertangled mess.
This makes my life easier for maintaining fastmem on ARMv7 because I now don't have to do any terrible instruction counting and NOP padding. Really
makes my brain stop hurting when working with it.

This enables fastmem for a whole bunch of new instructions, which basically means that all instructions now have fastmem working for them. This also
rewrites the floating point loadstores again because the last implementation was pretty crap when it comes to performance, even if they were the
cleanest implementation from my point of view.

This initially started with me rewriting the fastmem routines to work just like the previous/current implementation of floating loadstores. That was
when I noticed that the performance tanked and decided to rewrite all of it.

This also happens to implement gatherpipe optimizations alongside constant address optimization.

Overall this comment brings a fairly large speedboost when using fastmem.

This is the same extension that we all know and love but under a different name with some different requirements.
In regular OpenGL fashion, you can't just move a desktop OpenGL extension to OpenGL ES without ratifying a new extension, which is why this falls
under a EXT extension, which in turn causes it to have suffixes attached to their function names.

This is the first step in our way towards conquering all mobile GPUs that don't support desktop OpenGL, hopefully we also can add support for

'perf' is the standard builtin tool for performance analysis on recent
Linux kernel. Its source code is shipped within the kernel repository.

'perf' has basic support for JIT. For each process, it can read a file
named /tmp/perf-$PID.map. This file contains mapping from address
range to function name in the format:

41187e2a 1a EmuCode_804a33fc

with the following entries:

1. beginning of the range (hexadecimal);
2. size of the range (hexadecimal);
3. name of the function.

We supply the PowerPC address of the basic block as function name.

Usage:

DOLPHIN_PERF_DIR=/tmp dolphin-emu &
perf record -F99 -p $(pgrep dolphin-emu) --call-graph dwarf
perf script | stackcollapse-perf.pl | grep EmuCode__ | flamegraph.pl > profile.svg

Issue: perf does not have support for region invalidation. It reads
the file in postprocessing. It probably does not work very well if a
JIT region is reused for another basic block: wrong results should be
expected in this case. Currently, nothing is done to prevent this.

This doesn't seem to be necessary anymore now that FPRF is implemented in the
JIT. Technically, this isn't the same as before, since the JIT doesn't
implement the fcmp exception semantics, but as far as testing has shown, this
doesn't seem necessary.

This should make games that use FPRF a few percent faster (e.g. F-Zero GX)
since fcmpx no longer has to be fallbacked.

can try to launch it via a terminal, but at that point it's the user's

Changes the dispatcher to make sure to we are saving the LR(X30) to the stack. Also makes sure to keep the stack aligned.
AArch64's AAPCS64 mandates the stack to be quad-word aligned.

Fixes the dispatcher from infinite looping due to a downcount check jumping to the dispatcher. This was because checking exceptions and the state
pointer wouldn't reset the global conditional flags. So it would leave the timing/exception, jump to the start of the dispatcher and then jump back
again due to the conditional branch.

Previously we had decided to busy loop on systems due to Windows' scheduler being terrible and moving us around CPU cores when we yielded.
Along with context switching being a hot spot.
We had decided to busy loop in these situations instead, which allows us greater CPU performance on the video thread.
This can be attributed to multiple things, CPU not downclocking while busy looping, context switches happening less often, yielding taking more time
than a busy loop, etc.

One thing we had considered when moving over to a busy loop is the issues that dual core systems would now face due to Dolphin eating all of their CPU
resources. Effectively we are starving a dual core system of any time to do anything else due to the CPU thread always being pinned at 100% and then
the GPU thread also always at 100% just spinning around. We noted the potential for a performance regression, but dismissed it as most computers are
now becoming quad core or higher.

This change in particular has performance advantages on the dual core Nvidia Denver due to its architecture being nonstandard. If both CPU cores are
maxed out, the CPU can't effectively take any idle time to recompile host code blocks to its native VLIW architecture.
It can still do so, but it does less frequently which results in performance issues in Dolphin due to most code just running through the in-order
instruction decoder instead of the native VLIW architecture.
In one particular example, yielding moves the performance from 35-40FPS to 50-55FPS. So it is far more noticeable on Denver than any other system.
Of course once a triple or quad core Denver system comes out this will no longer be an issue on this architecture since it'll have a free core to do
all of this work.

We can't just check if AEP is in the extension list for support because Qualcomm has failed once more.
With the Nexus 6 it reports support for AEP but doesn't support OpenGL ES 3.1, which is an impossible combination.
From reports on their forum it seems that attempting to use any AEP things results in nothing happening, seems like a stub implementation.

Rumble is supported.  Hotplug is supported while playing a game.  If a controller is unplugged from the adapter, Dolphin will fallback to using the host input device on that port.  If a port on the adapter is unused, Dolphin will use the host input device for that port, allowing a mixture of host input devices and controllers connected to the adapter.

The adapter support can be disabled in the Controllers config if the OS driver is preferred (allowing the pad buttons to be reconfigured).

One adapter per system is supported.

Texture was being bound as a render target while still being set as a shader resource.
D3D automatically unbinds the SRV in this case and generates a validation error.
The fix is to manually unbind SRV, render into it and then re-bind to old slots.

Previously the two operand register selection bits were inverted, causing 'CMPAR AC1, AX0.H' to be disassembled as 'CMPAR AC0, AX1.H'.

DSP RE is always fun: on the one hand Nintendo does a lot of stupid shit, so anything weird could be a legitimate bug of the UCode that is not supposed to make any sense. On the other hand, Dolphin *also* does a lot of stupid shit, so there's always that doubt.

Note: completely untested change - done with the GH text editor, just to show you how much I care :) . These operand descriptions are only used for disassembly, so no real behavior change is expected.

Adreno 300 and 400 have the same video driver performance issues because they are very similar architectures which use basically the same thing with
everything.
There isn't any need to detect the family of the driver with Qualcomm anyway. If we ever need family specific bugs then we can implement real support
for that.
Performance issue on Adreno 400 series was due to us only detecting Adreno 300 series, and with Adreno 400 it wouldn't use the bugs, which would cause
it to use glBufferSubData, causing the huge performance hit.

This fixes running Dolphin on the Nexus 9.

Android's EGL stack has internal arrays that they use for tracking OpenGL function usage. Probably has something to do with their OpenGL profiling
garbage that used to be in ADT.

Android has three of these arrays, each statically allocated.
One array is for all GLES 1.x functions
One array is for all GLES 2.0/3.0/3.1 and a couple of extensions they deem worthy of being in this array.
The last array is for all function pointers grabbed via eglGetProcAddress that isn't in the other two arrays.

The last array is the issue that we are having problems with. This array is 256 members in length.
So if you are pulling more than 256 function pointers that Google doesn't track in their internal array, the function will return NULL and yell at you
in logcat.

The Nvidia Shield Tablet gets around this by replacing part of the EGL stack with their own implementation that doesn't have this garbage.
The Nexus 9 on the other hand doesn't get away with this. So we pull >100 more function pointers than the array can handle, and some of those we need
to use.

The workaround for this is to grab OpenGL 1.1 functions last because we won't actually be using those functions, so we get away with not grabbing the
function pointers.

Maybe some games does still run very fine without this hack.

These are mostly some edits to clean up inconsistencies in the Readme.

Rationale for the edits:

Switched places of Wii and Triforce in lists. Triforce emulation is pretty obviously not treated with the same importance as GameCube and Wii emulation is and so I feel it makes sense to have it listed last rather than second.

Made the spacing between slashes consistent. In some locations slashes had spaces and in others they didn't. I chose to add spaces throughout as it makes it a bit easier to read.

Gave Linux and OS X separate lines in the system requirements. If Windows gets its own line it makes sense for Linux and OS X to also have their own lines. This also clears up a potential ambiguity in what 10.9 is referring to.

Unified title capitalization. Some titles used capitals for the whole title and others only used capitals for the first word. I decided to capitalize all the titles.

Removed Vista or higher as higher as a requirement for using D3D. As Vista or higher is already a requirement for running Dolphin on Windows this is completely redundant. Also cleaned up a bit of a typo here.

Previously it was packed into spare slots in clippos.xy and normal.w,

This was discovered during the debugging of a zfreeze branch, which
expected clippos.xy to be xy position coordinates in clipspace (as
the name suggested).

Turns out the stereoscopy shader had also run into this trap, modifying
clippos.x (introducing errors with per-pixel lighting).

This commit has been moved outside of the zfreeze PR for fast merging.

There are a couple things in this PR.
Fixes a bug where if we hit an invalid instruction we would infinite loop.
Fixes an issue where on AArch64 it would show invalid instructions for all NEON instructions.
This was due to asimd and crc being optional extensions and LLVM not enabling them by default.
So we have to specify a CPU which has the feature. LLVM 3.6 will let us select by features instead of CPUs, but we don't have a release of that quite
yet.

If we are on an architecture that has a known instruction size, we will continue onward after hitting the invalid instruction. If we don't have a
known instruction size like on x86, we will instead just dump the rest of the block.

Instead of doing vector operations and throwing away the top 64bits of each operation, let's instead use scalar operations.
On Cortex-A57 this saves us three cycles per vector operation changed to scalar, so this saves 3-9cycles per instruction emulated.
Also puts one less micro-op in to the vector pipeline there.
On the Nvidia Denver I couldn't see any noticeable performance difference, but it's a quirky architecture so it may be noticing we are throwing away
the top bits anyway and optimizing it. The world may never know what's truly happening there.

Based on the feedback from pull request #1767 I have put in most of
degasus's suggestions in here now.

I think we have a real winner here as moving the code to
VertexManagerBase for a function has allowed OGL to utilize zfreeze now
:)

Correct use of the vertex pointer has also corrected most of the issue
found in pull request #1767 that JMC47 stated.  Which also for me now
has Mario Tennis working with no polygon spikes on the characters
anymore!  Shadows are still an issue and probably in the other games
with shadow problems.  Rebel Strike also seems better but random skybox
glitches can show up.

Results are still not correct, but things are getting closer.

* Don't cull CULLALL primitives so early so they can be used as reference
planes.
* Convert CalculateZSlope to screenspace coordinates.
* Convert Pixelshader to screenspace coordinates (instead of worldspace
xy coordinates, which is totally wrong)
* Divide depth by 2^24 instead of clamping to 0.0-1.0 as was done
before.

Progress:
* Rouge Squadron 2/3 appear correct in game (videos in rs2 save file
selection are missing)
* Shadows draw 100% correctly in NHL 2003.

This isn't really the right place to do this... but I'm not sure
how the code should be structured.

This leads to bugs on non-Windows: the Overclock parameter was

interpreted back as '0' (because the C locale is used for parsing the

If we successfully detach the kernel driver from the interface, we

And we should not use libusb_handle_events(), as the API says it is only
for backwards compatibility. Additionally, if the adapter thread is not
active, dolphin will take 60 seconds to close because the
libusb_handle_events() timeout is hardcoded to 60 seconds. Instead, use
libusb_handle_events_timeout_completed() with a timeout of 1 second.
Also, cancel the libusb transfers before the join(), to be able to close
the usb device without libusb screaming in the background (and
potentially crashing).

And finally, split the Init() and Shutdown() functions to avoid having
to init and exit libusb every time we neeed to detect the adapter.

Removes the requirement for stack allocated InputConfigDialogs to call Destroy. This shouldn't be necessary for wxDialog derivatives.
This also fixes a leak that would occur every time an InputConfigDialog is opened and closed. wxWindow subclasses (this includes wxDialog) only destroy child windows and sizers (including things in the sizers). So every wxTimer allocation would have resulted in a leak.

The PowerPC CPU has bits in MSR (DR and IR) which control whether

physical addresses and translated addresses into the same address space.

This is mostly mass-renaming calls to memory accesses APIs from places
which expect address translation to use a different version from those
which do not expect address translation.

This does very little on its own, but it's the first step to a correct BAT

This is the same trick which is used for Metroid's fonts/texts, but for all textures. If 2 different textures at the same address are loaded during the same frame, create a 2nd entry instead of overwriting the existing one. If the entry was overwritten in this case, there wouldn't be any caching, which results in a big performance drop.

The restriction to textures, which are loaded during the same frame, prevents creating lots of textures when textures are used in the regular way. This restriction is new. Overwriting textures, instead of creating new ones is faster, if the old ones are unlikely to be used again.

Since this would break efb copies, don't do it for efb copies.

Castlevania 3 goes from 80 fps to 115 fps for me.

There might be games that need a higher texture cache accuracy with this, but those games should also see a performance boost from this PR.

Some games, which use paletted textures, which are not efb copies, might be faster now. And also not require a higher texture cache accuracy anymore. (similar sitation as PR https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/pull/1916)

The obvious question here is, why does it matter if we round or truncate?
The key is that GC/Wii does fixed-point interpolation, where PC GPUs do
floating-point interpolation. Discarding fractional bits makes the conversion
from floating-point to fixed point give more consistent results.

I'm not confident this is really the right fix, or that my explanation is
completely correct; ideally, we don't want to depend on floating-point
interpolation at all.

This has a few advantages: it allows using EFB2Tex for a few more games,

Previously on FPR pushing and popping we would do a single STR/LDR per quad FPR we wanted to push/pop.
In most of our cases when we are pushing and popping VFP registers they will be consecutive registers that will save more efficiently using the NEON
loadstores that can do up to four quad registers.
So this can potentially cutting instructions down to ~1/4th the amount of instructions if the registers are all consecutive.

On the Cortex-A57 this is basically just an icache improvement, but on the Nvidia Denver this may be optimized to be more efficient. Either way it's a
win.

This came up from the discussion we were having prior about dumping half of a kilobyte of VFP registers to the stack is insanity.
This was due to me basically copying exactly what I did on ARMv7's paired loadstores, where the impact is less since we only use the bottom 64bits of
the VFP registers.

So I decided to think about how to improve upon this since I got called out on my terrible code.
The solution I have come up with is instead of jumping to the common ASM routine and having that check if it needs to take the fastmem or slowmem
routes, just inline the check in to the JIT block and jump to either a fastmem or slowmem handler.
Fairly simple, and this allows us to only flush the registers that are required when doing so. Should give a reasonable increase in performance for
games that use the slowmem path quite a lot.

With my previous changes Dolphin would fail to create the user directory if it didn't exist, and would dump all the configuration options in to the cwdir.
This was a bit more complicated to fix in a clean fashion, so I took to moving around code concerning user directories.
Instead of having GetUserPath serve a dual purpose of both getting and setting our user directories, break out to a new SetUserPath function.

GetUserPath will know only get the configured user path.
SetUserPath will set our user paths and setup the internal user path state.

This ending up being a lot cleaner overall, which is nice. Also less mind bending when attempting to read the code.

So now we won't dump all of our configuration in to the cwdir if ~/.dolphin-emu isn't found.

Fixes issue 8371.

Initially, the dialogs construct in the background when Dolphin initializes. However, it waits until the user actually makes the dialogs visible to decide on whether to create the Wii or GC control layouts.

Therefore, the call to CreateBaseLayout() essentially creates a sizer that isn't actually attached to a main sizer that is set as the sizer for the dialog to use. So upon destruction, these controls would never actually be destroyed if the user didn't open and then close the TAS dialogs.

via the destructor when s_emu_thread was set to a new thread.
(Incidentally, the destructor also makes explicitly joining on app exit
rather pointless.)

Because the GUI thread wasn't waiting for the CPU thread to fully shut
down, Core::IsRunning would remain true briefly after CFrame::DoStop
which, given Dolphin's penchant for accessing variables belonging to
other threads, can only mean trouble... In my case, because the previous
commit caused UpdateGUI, which is called at the end of DoStop, to call
PauseAndLock, which checks IsRunning, pressing stop at the right time
would cause strange behavior.

This was causing a race condition where the 'absurdly large aux buffer'
panic alert would be triggered in the last bit of fifo processing on the
CPU thread in deterministic mode (i.e. netplay).  SyncGPU is supposed to
move the auxiliary queue data to the beginning of the containing buffer
so we don't have to deal with wraparound; if GpuRunningState is false,
however, it just returns, because it's set to false by another thread -
thus it doesn't know whether RunGpuLoop is still executing (in which
case it can't just reset the pointers, because it may still be using the
buffer) or not (in which case the condition variable it normally waits
for to avoid the previous problem will never be signaled).  However,
SyncGPU's caller PushFifoAuxBuffer wasn't aware of this, so if the
buffer was filling at just the right time, it'd stay full and that
function would complain that it was about to overflow it.  Similar
problem with ReadDataFromFifoOnCPU afaik.  Fix this by returning early
from those as well; other callers of SyncGPU should be safe.  A
*slightly* cleaner alternative would be giving the CPU thread a way to
tell when RunGpuLoop has actually exited, but whatever, this works.

UpdateMemoryOptions to both.  There is a chance this could make

- Also call that function from ClearCache.
- Have MemChecks call ClearCache when the {first,last} watchpoint is

The purpose of blocking is to reload user INIs after they

rather annoying for games that have two default INIs,
because it makes it impossible to see both at once.

This affects enabling and disabling block profiling on the fly.
The block profiling pauses the CPU cores and then flushes the JIT's block cache and enables block profile.
The issue with this is that when we pause the CPU core, we don't have a way to tell if the JIT recompiler has actually left.
So if the secondary thread that is clearing the JIT block cache is too quick, it will clear the cache as a recompiler is still running that block that
has been cleared.

- FileSearch is now just one function, and it converts the original glob
into a regex on all platforms rather than relying on native Windows
pattern matching on there and a complete hack elsewhere.  It now
supports recursion out of the box rather than manually expanding
into a full list of directories in multiple call sites.

- This adds a GCC >= 4.9 dependency due to older versions having
outright broken <regex>.  MSVC is fine with it.

- ScanDirectoryTree returns the parent entry rather than filling parts
of it in via reference.  The count is now stored in the entry like it
was for subdirectories.

- .glsl file search is now done with DoFileSearch.

- IOCTLV_READ_DIR now uses ScanDirectoryTree directly and sorts the
results after replacements for better determinism.

Eventually, netplay will be able to use the host's NAND, but this could

a way to avoid using any preexisting NAND.

In terms of implementation: remove D_WIIUSER_IDX, which was just WIIROOT

separate variables rather than just using the actual path (fixed, since
they're actual Wii NAND paths) at the call site.  Then split off
D_SESSION_WIIROOT_IDX, which can point to the dummy NAND directory, from
D_WIIROOT_IDX, which always points to the 'real' one the user
configured.

Yet another story of games loading weird shit into registers.

For some reason, Burnout 2 would (in rare situations) load invalid
addresses into cp_state.array_bases. What would the real hardware
do in this situation? Who knows, Burnout 2 doesn't actually enable
the vertex array with the invalid address so nothing kinky happens.

But dolphin tries to optimise things and starts using the address
as soon as it is loaded into memory. This causes GetPointer (which is
now much more vocal) to throw an error.

The Fix:  We don't call GetPointer until we are sure the vertex array
has been enabled.

On OS X, if you close a subdialog of the ISO Properties dialog, such as
the one to add a new AR code, the main Dolphin window would magically
get raised above ISO Properties.  This is confusing, to say the least;
when I encountered this the other day, I thought the dialog was actually
getting closed.

I *think* the diagnosis looks like this:
Cocoa expects NSPanel (not to be confused with wxPanel) to be for things
like find dialogs, font dialogs with the little title bars, sheets, etc.
See:
https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/WinPanel/Concepts/ChangingMainKeyWindow.html
Therefore, NSPanels return NO for canBecomeMainWindow, which is
documented; and when [NSWindow orderOut:] is called to hide a window,
Cocoa seems to want to make the window it focuses in its place a main
window, which, as far as I can tell, is not.  So if the next highest
window is a panel, it gets skipped over.  (I tested this by overriding
wxNSPanel's canBecomeMainWindow to return YES, in which case the right
window gets focused, but this isn't a correct fix.)

The ISO Properties dialog does have grounds to be a dialog/panel - the
close button, whose positioning is provided by the wxDialog class.  This
is arguably simply a roundabout discovery that our UI sucks for an OS X
app and that to be consistent with other nonmodal preferences dialogs,
it shouldn't have such a button on OS X (though ESC to close is still
kosher).  However, I'm not willing to make that change right now, so...

Hack around the problem by calling Raise (on this) after each call to
ShowModal in CISOProperties.  The resulting behavior is slightly
glitchy, and I'd like to revisit it, but for now it fixes the issue.

This fixes issue 6563:
https://code.google.com/p/dolphin-emu/issues/detail?id=6563

This PR adds a 2nd map to texture cache, which uses the hash as key. Cache entries from this new map are used only if the address matches or if the texture was fully hashed. This restriction avoids false positive cache hits. This results in a possible situation where safe texture cache accuracy could be faster than the fast one.

Small textures means up to 1KB for fast texture cache accuracy, 4KB for medium, and all textures for safe accuracy.

Since this adds a small overhead to all texture cache handling, some regression testing would be nice. Games, which use a lot of textures the same time, should be affected the most.

The new implementation has 3 options:
SyncGpuMaxDistance
SyncGpuMinDistance
SyncGpuOverclock

The MaxDistance controlls how many CPU cycles the CPU is allowed to be in front
of the GPU. Too low values will slow down extremly, too high values are as
unsynchronized and half of the games will crash.
The -MinDistance (negative) set how many cycles the GPU is allowed to be in
front of the CPU. As we are used to emulate an infinitiv fast GPU, this may be
set to any high (negative) number.

The last parameter is to hack a faster (>1.0) or slower(<1.0) GPU. As we don't
emulate GPU timing very well (eg skip the timings of the pixel stage completely),
an overclock factor of ~0.5 is often much more accurate than 1.0
