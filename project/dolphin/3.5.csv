Renamed OnFrame.cpp/h to a more accurate Movie.cpp/h. Made some small changes that may improve movie synchronization.

"bb827eb8379ecdd34bddf60d173dcec30e4b832b","2011-07-12 15:49:08+00:00","Apply (a variation of) the first patch attached to issue 4608.  This should limit the amount of ACL packet loss due to the 200Hz timing (which is now 150Hz if you disable Wiimote Speaker) and the handling of the ACL pool when it's occasionally full (which this improves by dropping one packet instead of letting the 'pointers' overlap which would make packets unreachable).
See comment #6 for more details on the changes to WII_IPC_HLE_Device_usb.

In addition to that, rework some comments a bit (such as those from the
original patch; plus Ayuanx's one about maintaining Wiimote timing, which lost
relevance since r7272 which made Wiimote::Update timing independent from IPC
timing), and remove an unused global variable (event for watchdog hack)...

In short, this should address *some* of the Wiimote disconnection and/or 'forgotten extension' problems that appeared with r7272 and/or r7394.  To prevent the 'ACL queue is full' warnings from appearing (View->Show Log), pay attention to the amount of enabled Wiimotes (use as few as possible, connect the extra Wiimotes only when needed), and make sure to disable the 'Disable Wiimote Speaker' option (if unneeded or causing problems) in the game properties.  If possible, make sure to use real Wiimotes instead of emulated ones, as well.
If Wiimotes disconnect forever (and cannot be reconnected using the Alt+Fx hotkeys), open the Wiimote config window, set the faulty Wiimote's type to 'None', close/reopen the window, and set the previous Wiimote type back.

Note that it's not a *complete* fix for issue 4608!  This only fixes about half (or maybe third) of the possible causes of this issue...  But at least this should make the accurate Wiimote emulation (I mean, with the limitation of the ACL queue included) more usable in some cases (such as multi-player).
Nope, I didn't (and can't yet) perform in-depth tests on the real hardware myself (unlike some developers), I just rely on the given 'accurate' code and numbers (such as the 10-packet limit implemented by godisgovernment)...
Maybe I'll get to fixing other problem 'causes' (if I feel like doing it), maybe not in a while...  After all, I have other hobbies, and it's the summer holidays for me...

Anyway, feel free to test and comment.

With this code Red Steel 2 has much less stuttering and is actually playable on my hardware now. Other games probably benefit in other ways as well, but don't expect all kinds of stuttering to be magically fixed now.

For reference: Set EnableShaderDebugging to True if you experience any regressions, it should automatically tell you what's wrong then.

zcomploc is a feature of the BP which switch depth test from before the alpha
test to after the alpha test. This way, transparent fragments are written to
the depth buffer too.

The current implementation is quite hacky and does not cover all cases but is
enough to fix problems in a lot of game. A complete implementation would
require a multipass rendering method and is attempted in the
zcomploc-experimental branch.

According to testers feedback, fixes bugs in the following games:
- Baten Kaitos
- Baten Kaitos Origins
- 007: Everything or Nothing
- Ty the Tasmanian Tiger
- Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3

And probably other games too.

Passing MAP_FIXED to mmap causes already mapped pages in the requested
region to be replaced. On Mac OS X this caused pages for JIT-generatd
code to appear in the memory range previously auto-allocated for the RAM
of the emulated machine. This led to a hang at boot time. The same problem
can probably occur on FreeBSD, but not on Linux since MAP_32BIT is used
there instead of MAP_FIXED.

The solution is to not use MAP_FIXED, but instead rely on the OS honoring
the hinted address which is below 4 GB: we don't need an exact match,
just a low address.

Objective syntax. So it is not easy to determine exactly which source files

certain #include directives are modified. The solution for that would be to
move all uses of Objective syntax to implementation (.cpp) files and then

This patch makes a few changes necessary for support for the new Wii
Remotes:

- For all OSes:
- Adds a new bool member variable m_motion_plus_inside to identify
the new Wii Remotes.
- If we have a new Wii Remote, use a head byte of 0xa2. We could
just change this behavior for all Wii Remotes, but an existing
comment suggests that would break 3rd party Wii Remotes.

- On Mac OS X:
- Expand the search criteria for the bluetooth scan. This is
necessary because the new Wii Remote identifies with minor class
kBluetoothDeviceClassMinorPeripheral2Gamepad, but the old Wii
Remotes use minor class
kBluetoothDeviceClassMinorPeripheral2Joystick (1).
- Send commands on the interrupt channel, not the control
channel. The new Wii Remotes require this; old ones are compatible
with this. Note: 3rd party Wii Remots are untested with this
change; the hope is they are still functional.
- Get the name of the bluetooth device and see if it ends in
'-TR'. If so, set a member variable so we know it's the new kind
of Wii Remote.

This should fix issue 5011 for Mac OS X:

I think now, the Fifo in DC mode is more accurate than SC mode. :)

Time to close the big fifo Issue 3694 (snif), please if you have a possible fifo issue report this like a game issue.

I was working with Skid_AU together, especially thanks for him.

Test a lot all games, and compare the performance with the master maybe this accuracy has a cost (not a lot).
I think now the fifo is very stable, overflow fixed, random hang fixed, if you have a game with a hang with this rev and not in master please report this.

Commit 9ddb67d4a96a53698a71a7f3c8936c2437dd81de seems to have
introduced a segfault on Mac. The issue is that it this change casts
wxConvCurrent (which is a wxMBConvLibc) to a wxCSConv. This is an
unsafe cast because wxCSConv has member variables, but wxMBConvLibc
does not.

In LogWindow.cpp, the constructor for m_SJISConv is dereferencing one
of those member variables, which is a dereference of uninitialized
memory!

This CL reverts to the older (non-crashing) constructor, but keeps the
behavior the same.

to marcosvitali.

Added an external exception check when the CPU writes to the FIFO.  This allows
the CPU time to service FIFO overflows.  Fixes random hangs caused by FIFO
overflows and desyncs like in 'The Last Story' and 'Battalion Wars 2'.  Thanks
to marcosvitali for the research.

Added some code to unlink invalidated blocks so that the recompiled block can be
linked (speed-up).

This release still fixed the hangs produced by fifo overflow without sacrifice
performance. For example you can test Tutorial moves at the beginning of The last history now
is fluid 30/60.

Fixed possibles random hangs in DC mode.
Fixed hangs in DC mode in (Simpsons, Monkey Island, Pokemon XD, etc)
Implemented accurate management of Pixel Engine Interrupts.  Now the GPU loop
is stopped when a PE Interrupt needs to be managed and resumed when Pixel Engine
finish.

Fixed Metroid Prime 3 and 2 desync. And other games with desync because of
FIFO Reset. That happens because  FIFO_RW_DISTANCE_HI must be written first, for checking
fifo.CPReadWriteDistance == 0, so some fifo resets was not managed in the right
way.

Fixed Super Monkey Ball in some cases when the game write the
WriteReadDistance need to be safe like the SafeCPRead.

Improved the CheckException for the GatherPipe writes in JIT, now only the
External Exceptions are processed.

Fixed definitely Pokemon XD in dual core mode. This game is doing something
not allowed. It attach to CPU the same fifo attached to the GPU in multibuffer
mode. I added a check to prevent overwrite the GPU FIFO with the CPU FIFO. If
the game do that on breakpoint the solution can fail.

Added Token and Finish cause to GP Jit checking.

Future patches will address this problem in a better way.

* JIT-Exceptions:
JitIL code cleanup
Changed the JIT code to make the FPU exception timing more accurate.  The exception is now triggered at the first FP instruction instead of the start of the block. Rearranged the JIT exception code for a tiny speed-up.  Only external exceptions are checked at the end of the block.  All other exceptions are checked at the time they occur.

Fixes issue 5382.

Reason:
- It's wrong, zcomploc can't be emulated perfectly in HW backends without severely impacting performance.
- It provides virtually no advantages over the previous hack while introducing lots of code.
- There is a better alternative: If people insist on having some sort of valid zcomploc emulation, I suggest rendering each primitive separately while using a _clean_ dual-pass approach to emulate zcomploc.

Very useful to compare performance between two builds, check the impact of
a configuration option, etc. FPS log is stored in User/Logs/fps.txt and is
reset each time you launch a game. Only enabled if you check the 'Log FPS
to file' option in your graphics settings.

Could be improved a bit: currently logs only every 1s (so you can't really
see small variations), maybe output more infos to the fps.txt like
average/stddev (but Excel/Libreoffice/Google Docs can compute that easily
too).

Most of the InvalidateICache calls are for a 32 bytes block: this is the
number of bytes invalidated by PowerPC dcb*/icb* instructions. Profiling
shows that a lot of CPU time is spent checking if there are any JIT blocks
covered by these 32 bytes (using std::map::lower_bound).

This patch adds a bitset containing the state of every 32 bytes block in
RAM (JIT cached/not JIT cached). Using that, a 32 bytes InvalidateICache
can check in the bitset if any JIT block might be invalidated. A bitset
check is a lot faster than an std::map::lower_bound operation, improving
performance of JitCache::InvalidateICache by more than 100%.

Some practical numbers:

* Xenoblade Chronicles (PAL)
56.04FPS -> 59.28FPS (+5.78%)
* The Last Story (PAL)
30.9FPS -> 32.83FPS (+6.25%)
* Super Mario Galaxy (PAL)
59.76FPS -> 62.46FPS (+4.52%)

This function still takes more time than it should - more optimization in
this area might be possible (specializing for 32 bytes blocks to avoid
useless memcpy, for example).

So to compensate lets bring back some speed to the emulation.
change a little the way the vertex are send to the gpu,
This first implementation changes dx9 a lot and dx11 a little to increase the parallelism between the cpu and gpu.
ogl: is my next step in ogl is a little more trickier so i have to take a little more time.
the original concept is Marcos idea, with my little touch to make it even more faster.
what to look for: SPEEEEEDDD :).
please test it a lot and let me know if you see any problem.
in dx9 the code is prepared to fall back to the previous implementation if your card does not support the amount of buffers needed.
So if you did not experience any speed gains you know where is the problem :).
for the ones with more experience and compression of the code please test changing the amount and size of the buffers to tune this for your specific machine.
The current values are the sweet spot for my machine.
All must Thanks Marcos, I hate him for giving good ideas when I'm full of work.

This is set as default (I really got frustrated of having to change the type every single time when making tests for GCMM, and I think it makes more sense at user level to just show all saves regardless the format)

- In icon retrieving I removed the 'format check' as it shouldn't really matter to have mixed icon formats. Also removed the 'Time splitters hack' as there's no reason for it since we are only checking the last 3 bits and I'm pretty sure having bits 1 and 2 set is the same as having them unset.
- Icon retrieving uses AnimSpeed as stop signal (every icon must have an speed set, the first speed that is 0 means there are no more icons)
- Also, in icon retrieving I added support for 'blank frames'(Luigi's Mansion and Pikmin that I know of). With this the base for icon animation is complete.
- Fixed PSOIII savegame patch which was wrong before.
