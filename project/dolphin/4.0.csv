Only AX GC is merged so far, the new Wii AX development will be done in a
separate branch when I'll start working on it.

There are still a few AX GC bugs remaining, but overall a lot less games have
sound issues than before.

Thanks to everyone who helped test the development builds of this branch and
reported results on the forum thread.

* OpenAL:
Changed SoundTouch to use float samples, allowing SSE to be used. Made the DPL2 decoder disabled by default. Re-added the audio hack used by the Accurate VBeam emulation option.
Added a latency setting to the audio settings. Removed the Sample Rate setting.  It is now hardcoded to 48000hz (accurate audio timing).
Skipped timestretching if the emulator is running below 10% speed to prevent buffer overflows.
Removed the synchronisation between the CPU thread and the audio thread. Added code to detect and resume from buffer underruns. Disabled the ability to change the DPL2 option after the game has started. Fixed a memory leak that occurred in the DPL2 decoder. Fixed the OSX build.
Build fix
Added a Dolby Pro Logic II (DPL2) decoder in the OpenAL backend.  DPL2 audio is decoded to 5.1.  Code adapted from ffdshow. Added an option in the DSP settings to disable the DPL2 decoder in case Dolphin incorrectly detects a 5.1 audio system. Updated the OpenAL files to OpenAL Soft 1.15.1 in the Windows build.
Removed the system timing hack which was activated when the Accurate VBeam option was enabled.
Fixed the include directories in Audio Common for the Windows 32bit build.
Fixed the include directories in Audio Common for the Windows build.
Messed up the static include line
Fix include paths and compiling in Linux. Externals soundtouch is 1.7.1, while Ubuntu 12.10 is 1.6.x. Externals soundtouch is compiled with integer samples, while ubuntu is compiled with float samples. Float samples is probably the more common route. If you're going to use soundtouch, you should probably use SAMPLETYPE instead of explicitly choosing short. This probably breaks the windows build since its includes aren't setup.
OSX: typedef signed char BOOL
OSX build fix
Build fix
Added audio time stretching by using the SoundTouch library.
Implemented correct audio timing.

CSI - Fatal Conspiracy
Red Steel
Metroid Prime: Trilogy
Wii Sports + Wii Sports Resort pack
Sam & Max: Season One
Sam & Max: Beyond Time and Space
Kirby's Dream Collection: Classic Collection
Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings: Fate of Atlantis


* ES_LAUNCH:
Fixed SSBB from starting at the mini-games screen.
Build fix
Corrected a state bug where newly loaded dols did not have their patches applied.
Changed the HLE system to allow it to hook the beginning, the end or replace the entire function without changing the GC memory.  Fixes Kirby's Return to Dreamland. Added a way to categorise the type of HLE function.  Currently, there are debug, floating point, memory and generic functions. Added a HLE function for OSGetResetCode (Warm reset).  Fixes the CSI games. Added a switch to disable all of the HLE functions if the idle skipping option is disabled.
Added some IOS version checks and code to clear memory before loading the dol.
Added support for Reset (from menu).  Fixes Sam & Max.
Added an IOS check as games which use IOS older than IOS30 do not need to be HLE'd.  Added some stubs for Reset to Menu and SSBB's load from disc partition.  Fixed loading Fate of Atlantis from the Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings game.
Added argument detection and passing to the loaded dol.  This fixes the Wii Sports+Wii Sports Resort bundle pack.
Added preliminary support for ES_LAUNCH (Wii Multi-boot games) by using HLE to hijack the OSBootDol function.

Fixes two memory leaks, one is pretty bad for OSX. Yell at pauldachz if this doesn't work. Or... say thanks.
Added a BluetoothEnumerateInstalledServices call so that the wiimote remembers the pairing.
Make ARMJit core default CPU core on ARM architecture
Fix a StringUtil regression from the arm-noglsl merge
Small improvement to cmpli/cmpi in ARMJit.
Merge latest ArmEmitter changes from ppsspp while we're at it.
Ah. I blame vim on this typo entirely.
Add disabled code for authenticating wiimotes on Windows.
Add the missing FPR cache
Buildfix.
Yell at the user if they change window size while dumping frames, and some other avi dumping stuff.
Not sure if this is the right way to handle this, but it makes the save states perfectly stable. That's all that really matters, right?
Abort loading states from incompatible graphics backends.
ARM Support without GLSL
Improve VideoSoftware save states. They are fairly stable, but not perfect. OpcodeDecoder::DoState() needs to be fixed.
Begin implementing save states to video software. Kind of works, sometimes.
Make error message for loading save state with wrong dsp engine shorter.
Abort load state if it uses a different dsp engine, instead of crashing.
Update the gameini of F-zero. Efb to Ram is no longer the default choice.

Adds support for PE performance metrics.
Used in Super Mario Sunshine's 'Scrubbing Sirena Beach' level to determine when enough goop has been cleaned up to finish the level.
Also used in TimeSplitters: Future Perfect to determine the appearance of flares around light sources (e.g. sun).

OpenGL and D3D11 only. D3D9 support unlikely to be added unless anyone bothers to do the work.
Initial work and D3D11 support by me. Kudos go to Billiard for adding the OpenGL support and reviving development of this branch that way :D

Slightly (~7%) decreases performance when performance metrics are used (and only then).

# By skidau (30) and Pierre Bourdon (1)
* FIFO-BP: (31 commits)
Set g_bSignalTokenInterrupt on the main thread.  Fixes the random hang in Harry Potter: Prisoner of Azkaban.
Used a scheduled event to generate the ARAM DMA interrupt if the DMA is greater than a certain size.  Fixes NFS:HP2 GC.
Bumped up the disc transfer speed enough to prevent audio stuttering in Gauntlet: Dark Legacy.
Enabled Synchronise GPU on 'SPEED CHALLENGE - Jacques Villeneuve's Racing Vision'.  Required to go in-game.
Added direct GameCube controller commands to the Serial Interface emulation.  Fixes the controls in MaxPlay Classic Games Volume 1 and the Action Replay disc.
Increased the FIFO buffer size to 2MB from 1MB.  Fixes Killer 7's Angel boss.
Used an immediate GenerateDSPInterrupt when transferring data from ARAM to MRAM and a scheduled DSP interrupt when transferring data from MRAM to ARAM.
Fixes the audio cutting in and out in the Resident Evil GC games using DSP HLE. Triggered the ARAM interrupt by the scheduler instead of directly in function.
Implemented proper timing for the sample counter in the AudioInterface, removing the previous hack. Cleaned up some of the audio streaming code.
Skipped the EE check if there is a CP interrupt pending.
Disabled 'Speed up disc transfer' from the ZTP GC game ini.
Removed the disc seek times for GC games and removed the disc speed option on Wii games. Checked for external exceptions only in mtmsr.
Delayed the interrupts in the EXI Channel.
Merge aram-dma-fixes (r76a13604ef49b522281af75675f044d59a74e871)
Added a patch that bypasses the FIFO reset code in Wallace and Gromit: Project Zoo, allowing it to go in-game.
Made vertex loading take constant time.
Increased the cycle time of the vertex command.  Fixes 'Speed Challenge: Jacques Villeneuve's Racing Vision'.
Moved the setting of the Finish interrupt signal back to the main thread as it was causing Wii games like Resident Evil 4 (Wii) to hang.
Profile stores, fp stores and ps stores only to the fifo write addresses list.  This should make the JIT a little faster as it will not be checking for external exceptions unnecessarily.

Merge an endless story. The branch name is a lie, it was started as glsl, but now it is a complete reworked opengl3 backend.

It just began with simple changes which aren't supported on osx.
They either support ogl2 OR ogl3 core, but mixing isn't allowed.
As the branch name says, the vicious circle starts with GLSL, but just implementing one wasn't possible either:
- OSX supports only GLSL100 which doesn't support our shaders.
- Vertex Array Objects are needed for ogl3, but not supported on ogl2
- immediate mode isn't supported any more, so we must implement vertex buffers
- uniform buffers are recommended as else we would need tons glUniform
- postprocessing shaders have to be converted to glsl
- lots of smaller outdated issues and bug fixes :-)

Thanks at all for testing and at Sonic for converting all of our shaders to glsl130

And sorry for all upcoming bugs...

At the end of July 2011, LM published a free DSP ROM that works with games
using the Zelda UCode. His ROM only has the code to handle UCode loading and a
few utility functions, the rest is missing. This includes the four large sound
mixing functions used by the AX UCode and the DROM containing coefficients used
for polyphase resampling in AX.

This is an improved, updated version of this ROM, which changes the following:

- We now have a free DROM that works for polyphase resampling by 'emulating'
linear interpolation. The coefficients contained in the DROM are normally a
list of { c1, c2, c3, c4 } which are used to interpolate a sample value from
four previous samples:
out_sample = prev1 * c1 + prev2 * c2 + prev3 * c3 + prev4 * c4

The coefficients are chosen depending on the fractional part of the current
position (basically, our position between the previous and the next sample).
We can use this fact to generate (c1, c2, c3, c4) for each possible
fractional part so that:
out_sample = prev3 * curr_pos + prev4 * (1 - curr_pos)

Which is the formula for linear interpolation between prev3 and prev4. Linear
interpolation is not as good as polyphase resampling but it still works very
well and I couldn't really hear any difference between the two. If someone
wants to generate real polyphase filter coefficients, they are welcome to
submit a patch.

- The IROM now contains the 4 mixing functions used by the AX UCode: mix_add,
mix_add_two, mix_add_ramp, mix_add_ramp_two. They are large, inlined
functions (probably for performance reasons) in the official DSP IROM, our
version prefers to use a loop. This *should* be more performant with our DSP
JIT implementation, but I did not benchmark that.

Because the new DSP ROM is working just as well as the official ROM in 95% of
cases, it is now shipped by default with Dolphin and will be used with DSPLLE
if you don't have an official DSP ROM in User/GC. It will still display a panic
alert at every boot to notice you that you are using a non official DSP ROM
made by us, which is not perfect.

Games using the CARD, IPL or GBA UCodes are still broken. I don't know what
games this actually impacts, but this is a very small proportion compared to
what works.

fragment would still be executed, but still with the center of the pixel as position.
So if some calculations aren't allowed outside the polygon, the result would be invalid.

But the nice one: we can give a hint to each input to be choosen from a valid pixel,
so now every pixel will be calculated with valid source.

Sorry for a direct commit to the main branch but i need fast feedback, and i don't want to leave problematic code in the main branch for a long time.
if this approach does not work for the drivers with problems will transform dual source blend to an option in the D3D9 backend.
I appreciate the help of the people that tested my last commit and thanks to neobrain for pointing this solution.

This commit mainly elaborates on some messages a little more. Also fixes some typos that slipped through the last commit.

A large change in text can be seen in EXI_DeviceMemoryCard.cpp. I added more info as to why a write to a memory card may fail. (This actually was a reason I was unable to write to a memcard recently).

Elaborations can be seen in WGL.cpp

I did change some comments in some files that I was correcting logging messages in, however this is only if I spot a typo or if an abbreviation is lower-cased. Even in that case, the amount of changes done to comments is very minimal.

GC and Wii games using the AX UCode should now work almost perfectly with DSP
HLE. If you get any issue, make sure the 'DSP on dedicated thread' option is
disabled, and try setting framelimit to 'Audio'.

As a side effect, DSP HLE should not desync anymore (making it usable in
netplay and TAS) with AX games.

Solution

when there's a running emulation: fix the button

when there's no running emulation: disable the button (to indicate to the user that this button must be clicked elsewhere, in the ISO settings dialog, the user will realise or remember)

Example (in step by step explanation):

1. Run Dolphin.

2. Go to Tools -> Fifo Player

3. Go to the Record tab and hit record and then stop without a game loaded.

The button is now disabled and will not become active again for the whole time that Dolphin is running. Dolphin must be closed and then re-opened in order to use it again. This fixes that.

I've tested it with multiple conditions to make sure this doesn't beef anything else related to the Fifo Player.

ie)

- Record then Stop without a game loaded (multiple times)
- Record then Stop with a game loaded (multiple times, as well as testing playback. All of which work fine).

Replaces the old, hardcoded shader ID generator with a semi-automatic mechanism that generates IDs from hints in the code generator.

Also introduces a flexible framework to do all kinds of funky stuff with the shader code generation logic. As an example, a uniform usage profile generation class is added (unused for now, though).

Functionality can still be tested by setting the EnableShaderDebugging field in the gfx config to True. Any two shaders which are identified with the same ID will be written to a file and an error message will be written to the Dolphin log.

This contains a new, hand-written expression parser to replace the old
hack language based on string munging. The new approach is a simple
AST-based evaluation approach, instead of the 'list of operations'
infix-based hack that there was before.

The new language for configuration has support for parentheses, and
counts '!' as a unary operator instead of the binary 'NOT OR' operator
it was before. A simple example:

(X & Y) | !B

Explicit device references, and complex device names ('Right Y+') are
handled with backticks and colons:

(`SDL/0/6 axis joystick:Right X+` & `DInput/0/Keyboard Mouse:A`)

The basic editor UI that inserts tokens has not been updated to reflect
the new language.

This fix the 1h32 audio bug which outputs static sound after 1h32.

The mixer is used for 32->48kHz resampling and as output buffer for the async audio backends.
So this buffer was indiced by a writing and a reading pointer and the count of samples in it.
As this is redundant and the sample count isn't accurate calculateable because of the interpolation,
both indices gets out of sync. So after some time (~92min), this buffer overflows and return only garbage.

thx @ moosehunter + delroth for debugging on this issue. You did the most work :-)

This should be transparent, but it may cause regressions.

The idea here is that now all players, including the host of the server,
talk to the server through TCP/IP networking. This significantly reduces
our codepaths through netplay, and will prevent strange local-only bugs
from happening.

The cleanup isn't 100% finished yet. The NetPlay dialog still drives the
server through private APIs. I eventually want to sanction off the server
entirely, so all communication is done through TCP/IP. This will allow us
to have high-traffic public servers that can relay multiple games and
lobbies at a time, and split off channel and game management to people
other than the host.

This is all still just a pipe dream, though.

Added an example translation (Japanese). So now the Android version can both display in English and Japanese, depending on what the Android device's system language is set to.

Also did a tiny clean-up of InputConfigItem.java so that the parameters are slightly more descriptive.

Now, to do a translation in [x] language, all you have to do is take the normal English strings.xml and translate the XML entries into said language, and simply make a folder in the /res/ sub-directory in the form of values-[region code]. IE) With the Japanese translation, it is in the folder /res/values-ja

No configuration other than that is needed. After doing the above, the language should load fine on any device when set to that specific system language.

By default, if a translation file does not exist for a given system language. The app will automatically fall back to using the English translation.

This *should* be bug-free since I did check everything multiple times. But if any issues occur, please report them so that I can fix them.

Previously it was possible for a game with the same path and name to be in the list as another. This is annoying because duplicates ae (obviously) no different from the initial item.

This prevents duplicates from entering the list.

The way this works is:

1. We get the final list of items to add to the list.

2. Loop through it using two indices, which, for this explanation I'll call [item] and [itemAfter]

We compare path name at item with index [item] and the path name at item with index [itemAfter]
To phrase this numerically comparison works like so:

for (int i = 0; i < listSize; i++)
{
if (i+1 < listSize)
item[i].getPath().equals(item[i+1].getPath())
}

3. For each path comparison that is true, remove item at [indexNext].

Pad mapping and the UI behind it is significantly confusing,
and has been confusing users since NetPlay was introduced.

As part of a large code cleanup to help NetPlay more stable,
introduce a better pad mapping system where local pad mapping
is handled by the client. Now, all the server and other
clients know is which player have which controllers, and the
clients only know this so they can show the pad mapping in the
UI; they don't do anything else with it.

A future cleanup will use this pad mapping data to completely
ignore the pads configured in the settings pane on the host.

(Intertwined enough that's it's easier to do in one patch.)

(1) /dev/es did not support state save, which could cause crashes and
incorrect behavior after loading.

(2) NANDContentLoader tried to read all of a title's contents into
memory when it was first opened.  Two issues:

- If any contents were missing, it bailed out.  However, with DLC,
only some of the contents may be downloaded, as determined by the
permission bits in the ticket.  Instead, return an appropriate error
when a content is accessed that doesn't exist on the filesystem
(don't bother checking the permission bits though).

- Everything was loaded into memory - even if it consisted of 3 GB of
songs, which caused Dolphin to lag out for quite a while (and would
fail on 32-bit).  Instead, open content on demand.

operator, which is supposed to delete the implicitly declared copy
assignment operator, but of course MSVC didn't do that either, causing a

On OS X, openL2CAPChannelSync registers events on the current
thread's run loop, so Connect needs to be called on a thread that's
going to do CFRunLoopRun; this was causing all Wiimote input to be
ignored.  Easiest way to do that is to use the Wiimote thread, and
have Read call CFRunLoopRun to block on events, bringing OS X's
Wiimote event loop in line with every other platform's.  This also
means that the thread can't be stopped and recreated by Prepare,
so make Prepare notify it instead, which has the side effect of not
making the GUI block on Prepare.  (It would be nice if the GUI also
did not block on searching for devices, because blocking the GUI
is gross, but for now...)

0x81070000, causing random corruption.  Since the PPC does not normally
have access to those registers, there is no reason to be doing this in
the first place.  Use a member to store these values instead.

(Also add a proper DoState.)

V45 of the driver has broken shader compilation with UBOs in the shaders, this is most likely fixed with V53 found in the Nexus 5. Add a bug for issue surrounding on screentext and doing a glClear after swap causes screen swizzling and zero frames rendered respectively.  On the Java side, pass in the dimensions of the screen swapped since there is an issue with Adreno where it rotates the output 90 degrees for some reason. Disable the GLSL shader cache on Android for now due to the inability to cleanly exit the emulator, this tends to cause the cache to get corrupted. All this together fixes rendering with Adreno 3xx GPUs with driver version v14 and above. In particular my Galaxy S4 still resets with this without the root commands, but my HTC Droid DNA and LG G2 is fine. This must be due to particular 'enhancements' that the Samsung kernel has over the other ones. The speed on Adreno has yet to be optimized, so it will most likely be slow still. Faster than the software rasterizer in any case. The ARMJIT is still broken in at this point, so not much fun can be had.

ProtectFunction thunks, which do not.  This was causing many games
to crash on start on OS X.  Since this might otherwise mean changing
the stack pointer before every call...

- Have one prolog/epilog function rather than two (one of which
definitely did not do what it was thought to do), and make it
actually work like a normal one, so that the stack frame shows up
properly in the debugger.  There should be no performance impact.
