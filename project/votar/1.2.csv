* Reduced false positive detection rate with better burned pixel handling, wont detect 2 patterns on the top of one as much now
* Replaced #0000FF with #00FF00 in all patterns because blue is too dark in low light rooms, get affected too much by low warm lighting
* Shifted the patterns around a bit. Not finished because need stability for testing (invert cyan and yellow in nativeAnalyze pending).
