Replaces requiresSetup metadata tag with a separate setupActivity metadata element, allowing sources to completely separate the setup logic from their Settings activity if they chose. Rework the Gallery extension to take advantage of this, removing the need for a specific GallerySettingsProxyActivity.

Current flow for the Gallery source is now:
- If the storage permission is granted or the user previously selected any images, enable the source on click
- Otherwise, ask for the storage permission
- If denied, send the user to the Settings activity to show rationale/a link to app settings or allow users to select photos
