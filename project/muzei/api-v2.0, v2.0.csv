A stumbling block for any Muzei developer who initially tries to checkout and then import Muzei into Android Studio is that the keystore.props.file entry in local.properties is required, causing the import to error out until you 1) figure out why the error occurred and 2) figure out how to fix it.

As there are few, if any, Muzei developers who need to build a release build (the only time when these values are actually required), we can make the keystore.props.file value optional, allowing new developers to immediately checkout, import, and build a debug APK without issue.

Building a release build with a null storeFile will error out the build as expected, but in that case the developer is more likely to know where to look - in the signingConfig.releaseConfig section which defines this loading behavior.

On some devices such as the Nexus 10 and Samsung Galaxy Note 2014, when you use a low amount of blur (triggering the mMaxPrescaledBlurPixels == 0 case), blurrer.destroy() freezes the app, causing images to no longer load until you force stop the app. As the ImageBlurrer is not actually needed unless mMaxPrescaledBlurPixels is greater than 0, we can move the allocation and destruction of it inside the else block. This ensures that the app works as expected in either case.

GridLayouts are the new, more performant alternative to TableLayout (as explored in #3). This diff converts the advanced settings layout to use a GridLayout, allowing text to align to the right properly and grow the width of the left column as the text changes (as would happen in different languages).

This uses some extremely lightweight Space elements with columnSpan='2' to add spacing between rows (rather than applying a marginTop to an element and aligning as was done in the RelativeLayout). To keep the number of views low, however, the checkbox rows that only a single element still use marginTop

Large icon size is set by android.R.dimen.notification_large_icon_height and changed between pre-Android 5.0 and 5.0. To ensure the best large icon, we use the provided dimension - Android by default does not center crop too large of images so the fixed size was giving strange results, particularly on low resolution devices.

While there isn't a set size for BigPictureStyle backgrounds, this background is used on Android Wear devices, which suggest a 400x400px background per http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/notifications/creating.html#AddWearableFeatures - we load a separate background image of this size.

In #65, we moved from setServer() to setEndpoint(). However, that method does not exist in the Retrofit 1.3.0 we were using. Update to Retrofit 1.7.1 to gain access to the setEndpoint() method. Also fixes the deprecation of isNetworkError().

MuzeiContract has been added to the api library as well as helper methods for serializing/deserializing Artwork with ContentProvider classes.

Previously, Muzei assumed that if a file specified by an art source was downloaded that it was a valid image, leading to crashes when loading the BitmapRegionLoader on an invalid file. This fix attempts to open the image immediately after writing it to ensure that the image is valid and able to be parsed by Muzei. By doing this at the ArtworkCache level, we can properly mark the error state and show grumpy mcpuzzles for invalid images.
