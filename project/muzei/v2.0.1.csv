When connectionResult.getErrorCode() == ConnectionResult.API_UNAVAILABLE, this means we are on an unsupported device and we should not attempt to update the data layer. However, since that status is unlikely to change over the course of the app's lifecycle, creating a warning message each and every time this happens is unnecessary. Instead, we can do a simple verbose statement that does not spam logcat unless specifically requested.

In the case where the user has just updated to Muzei 2.0+ (i.e., went from no Wearable app to a Wearable app) AND has not yet had their wallpaper change, there may be cases where the DataLayer has valid artwork, but it is not yet cached locally or made available via the Artwork API.

In those cases, the Muzei watch face would show a notification stating that the user should activate Muzei when no artwork is found. Instead, we should attempt to retrieve the artwork from the DataLayer first and only if that fails should we show the activate Muzei notification.

Note: this moves a lot of code from MuzeiWearableListenerService to ArtworkCacheIntentService, but the functionality is identical.

Previously, we would create the scaled image in onDraw the first time after a resize event or after a new image was loaded. However, by utilizing onSurfaceChanged we can retrieve the current width and height prior to onDraw, allowing us to move the scaling from onDraw(). This also allows us to handle the more common case of a new image being loaded and allows us to scale the new image on the background thread.

Fixes #122 by
1) Doing a check on API level before attempting to connect to the Wearable API (as Wearable API is not available prior to Android 4.3 / Jelly Bean MR2 so no need to attempt to connect)
2) Limiting the timeout to 5 seconds to reduce any delay even on 4.3+ devices.
