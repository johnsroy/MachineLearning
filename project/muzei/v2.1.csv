Show date on the watch face in MM/dd or dd-MM (locale dependent) format:
- Round: Date is shown above the time (as time is centered on the screen / floating directly above peek card)
- Square: Date is shown below the time (as the time is in the upper right corner)

On activating the Muzei Watch Face, occationally `onDraw()` will be called between when a background is set (`mBackgroundBitmap != null`) and when the scaled bitmap is created (`mBackgroundScaledBitmap != null`) which led to it attempting to draw a null scaled background. Change `onDraw()` to also check against `mBackgroundScaledBitmap` to prevent crashes.
