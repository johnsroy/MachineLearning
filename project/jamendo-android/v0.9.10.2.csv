Jamendo API returns only first 20 tracks for album query. It is possible to ask/retrieve
all however for long albums it might happen that query will fails as it is memory-limited
by Jamendo servers. Therefore it is only a preliminary solution and proper pagination implementation
is in progress.

Crash was caused by a Toast being displayed outside of UI thread.
This toast is also unnecessary in loadRecommendedRadios because
if null is returned from RadioLoadingDialog::doInBackground then fail message
is displayed.
