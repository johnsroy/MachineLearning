Rootcause:
The rootcause was timing problems during first run.
If you open Jamendo URL and there was no already jamendo working in PlayerActivity.java:
1. OnCreate->HandleIntent->UriLoadingDialog you start Async task for downloading playlist
2. OnResume it checks if playlist is empty, and was because AsyncTask havent finished yet
3. AsyncTask completed downloading playlist

Changed order in fix
1.3.2
