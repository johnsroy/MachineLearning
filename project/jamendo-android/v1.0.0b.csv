When non-paginated getAlbumTracks() is called it performs paginated track retrieval using 10 tracks per page.

Tracks are now stored within Album instances - a binding between Album and its Tracks.
The Jamendo API implementation doesn't automatically store tracks in given Album.
This operation is still to be performed by caller of getAlbumTracks().
