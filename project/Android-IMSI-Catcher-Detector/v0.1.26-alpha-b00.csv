My inbox is getting spammed by Error Logs and none of the logs I've received to far, contain **any** relevant descriptive information of the problem. So since I'm no longer able to continue develop on this project as before, I've changed the email to use @SecUpwN, who can then forward bug report to developers, or change to his own masked email.

"ac69bf75bf1d4955bdee58f1d299f2c1ab03805e","2015-04-24 15:40:10-05:00","Update README.md

I have a github account so I might as well change some grammar.  Added an Oxford comma since the rest of the page uses them :), removed some extraneous commas (lists of 2 things don't need them unless you're going for an intentional pause) & removed an unnecessary preposition.  I'm guessing the preposition was from a translation from another language?
