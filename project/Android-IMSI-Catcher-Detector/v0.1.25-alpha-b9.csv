All AOSP specific items have been removed to allow for Universal Compatibility this includes the
AOSP frameworks and telephony class libraries and the OemHookRil class which implemented methods
that required the hidden SDK methods.

Functionality has been reduced to showing device information at present and will be extended once
methods are discovered to issue AT commands, tracking of Cell Info, Signal Strength and Location
are still available.

Settings have been added but need to be completed but the basic items are displayed.

Changes mean the application no longer needs to be signed using the AOSP platform key and functions
correctly as a user application and should also function on any device.

Femtocell Detection will be implemented full for CDMA devices in the next commit.

Project changed to gradle build system as I have switched to Android Studio for my main IDE,
this change is quite significant in terms of layout of the application source code and the
abilities provided by gradle.

Google Maps API v2 support added to enable use of new features and gain an API Key for the
application as API v1 keys are no longer available, signal strength data is now correctly
overlayed on the map as well. Minor tweaks are required but currently everything is functioning
correctly, the next items to add could include markers to identify tracked CellID's and user
options to modify map preferences.

Database export corrected and changed to use the OpenCV library to produce CSV copies of the database tables.

Added missing resources for Actionbar icons which I had initially only added for HDPI devices,
all other defined display types have been added.

MapView updated to check for Google Play Services so no FC's are experienced by people who do not
use these services, added option to select map type and extended the details the system will apply
to the map including markers for unique CellID's found and signal overlays.

MapView will now default to last known location (if one is available) or will zoom to the last
loaded location found in the tracking database, other map controls enabled to allow gesture
control.

GeoLocation class added from paper written by Jan Philip Matuschek found here -
http://janmatuschek.de/LatitudeLongitudeBoundingCoordinates
This provides an equation to determine a bounding radius of a given point, for example
a cirle 50 miles/kilometres around a given location.

The reasoning behind this is to allow these calcuations to be performed so external API's
such as the one offered by OpenCellID.org can be utilised to provide known CellID and tower
locations which could be enabled within MapView.

Preference change is now detected correctly by the application showing immediate changes to
through the persistant notification for system status (Idle, Good & Alarm).

FEMTOCELL DETECTION ACTIVATED (Requires testing on CDMA devices)
Femtocell detection has been enabled for initial testing (CDMA devices ONLY) this must be enabled
through the menu and I will extend the preferences to enable the auto start option for detection
and also implement the evasive action preference to enable Airplane mode if detected with a
customisible automatic reset time period or manual control.

Major update of the database helper functions to significantly improve the insert and update of records

OpenCellID database table added and this will be populated/updated whenever OpenCellID data is requested

average signal strength to assist in IMSI detection.

Removed the CMDProcessor as this was not being utilised at all except for a couple of helper methods which
have been moved into the main AIMSICD path, this can added back at a later stage if required as it provides
a very well executed shell management system, also removed some unneeded imports and cleaned up little bits

data and responses.

Huge code cleanup and updates to a number of areas with optimisations across a large
number of packages, some unused imports removed and code comments added to a variety
of methods.

Addressed a number of possible NPE causes through different parts of the application
which will ultimately provide better stability and an increased user experience,
although in saying that these items were not causing any issues that had been reported
but prevention is better then a cure right?!?! :)

the highler langauge level with removal of explicit types within arrays, lists, maps
etc plus other changes.

Unnecessary compatibility library removed which has resulted in a reduction in size

Current status of cell & location tracking is as follows:
- Enabling Cell Tracking (Only Option) requires GPS enabled to provide location
details for the cell.
- Currently as no other method has been tested the GPS lat/lng coordinates are used
to populate both tables (Cell & Location) until another method is confirmed to work
as required to provide the exact CELL LOCATION to be used within the Cell tracking
table.
- GPS location changes will only be tracked if more then 10 metres change in location
has been registered.

Other minor updates including additional logic checks added to all functions that
request SIM variables to ensure the sim state is ready.

First thing you need to do before using this is give a BIG THANK YOU to @E3V3A (E:V:A
on xda) for determining how this implementation was possible because without his
perseverance this would not be possible!

ROOT IS REQUIRED!!

Root terminal methods are used to execute the AT Command Injection so this fragment
will check for both ROOT (su binary) and BUSYBOX to confirm both are available on
your device, if not the execution section of the fragment WILL NOT DISPLAY.

If the initial setup works correctly the next step is trying to determine your Ril
Serial Device through the system property ril.libargs if this is successful then
you are in business and the AT Command Injection system is available for you to test.

This will probably NOT WORK on many devices (such as my i9100) but it will provide
details of the failure if available and display them to the screen but also write them
to the file error.txt in the AIMSICD directory of your external storage.

Have fun and try not to break anything.

reported in some forums or my crappy i9100.

This method has been initially implemented for testing within the OpenCellID update
methods as a fallback when no location can be found from Location Services, this of course can be extended for further uses such as battery saving mode to enable use of
AIMSICD without the need for active GPS.

To assist with detection method 1 (Changing LAC) and for correct implementation of the

only ONE (1) entry is stored for each CID. The location table continues to store
multiple results based on the changing location and signal strength.

But the Cell Information Table will now only contain a single entry for each unique
CID.

Initial implementation for detection method 1 to compare the CID & LAC with the Cell
Information Table contents as an initial implementation for detection of a changed LAC,
once OCID issues (API key use etc) have been finalised this detection method can be
extended to include checking of external data.

This initial implementation is activated through the drawer menu item titled
'Monitor Cell Information' which will invoke timed runnable that will poll the Cell
Location details using the selected refresh rate OR default to 25 seconds if
Automatic/Manual has been selected, once testing is complete this can be enabled as a
passive detection method which can could be controlled through a user preference.

As I have no real way of testing this I require testing by other project members who
do have access to equipment or an environment where a changing LAC can be simulated
thus confirming the accuracy of this implementation.

Presently this will only invoke the MEDIUM threat level through the notification and
does not fully implement the capturing and score based method as per the issue details
once further testing is complete the alert and tracking of information can be refined.

Totally re-wrote the AT Command Injection system using the RootTools library

releases.

confirmed.

need to check your IDE to confirm it is including RootTools.jar if you face

The prompting to enable GPS now better handles the users selection and

The activity itself forces a check as I cannot use the method
startActivityForResult from within the service, so whenever the activity
binds to the service or invokes onResume it will check the GPS location
service is running if Cell Tracking is enabled.

This also forces the user to either enable GPS or cancel the dialog box
which will leave the app in a desired state of operation.
