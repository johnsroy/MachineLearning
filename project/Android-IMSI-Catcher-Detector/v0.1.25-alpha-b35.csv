Fixed NC detection logic and added more Logs to be removed or verbose,
once working.

- Found new bug to be reported:
The code in CellTracker: updateNeighbouringCells() is only executed in
MapViewer and not all the time as needed. It should be updated as soon
as a new CID is connected to or every REFRESH_RATE seconds. And outside
of MapViewer as well...

- Tried to fix the progress bar in the RequestTask Downlaod request,
only to discover that for streamed downloads, aka Chunked Transfer
Encoding, the total size cannot be obtained, which mean that a progress
bar cannot be used. Tried to take care of this gracefully by setting
'total' to an arbitrary value., and progress to half of it. However, we
could use a spinner GIF, but barely worth the effort...
- Added some TAGs.

- polished CellTracker from junk comments
- Added TAGs to Helpers and Device
- Corrected TAG in DeviceAPI17 and were looking for a funny bug causing
the following error:

'E/dalvikvm( 4600): Could not find class
'android.telephony.CellInfoWcdma',referenced from method
com.SecUpwN.AIMSICD.utils.DeviceApi17.loadCellInfo'

Didn't find it!  @tobykurien Please have a look as you wrote this code.
