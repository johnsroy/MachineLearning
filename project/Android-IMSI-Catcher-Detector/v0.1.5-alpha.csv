All AOSP specific items have been removed to allow for Universal Compatibility this includes the
AOSP frameworks and telephony class libraries and the OemHookRil class which implemented methods
that required the hidden SDK methods.

Functionality has been reduced to showing device information at present and will be extended once
methods are discovered to issue AT commands, tracking of Cell Info, Signal Strength and Location
are still available.

Settings have been added but need to be completed but the basic items are displayed.

Changes mean the application no longer needs to be signed using the AOSP platform key and functions
correctly as a user application and should also function on any device.

Femtocell Detection will be implemented full for CDMA devices in the next commit.
