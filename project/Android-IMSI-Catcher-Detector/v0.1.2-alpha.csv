This commit takes the first small step forward for this project and includes a number
of changes which I will try and document below but some items may be forgotten.

* Package name updated for the project to: com.SecUpwN.AIMSICD

* Manifest updated and modifed to run sharing the system user process
which allows for access to the phone process and main looper which enables
execution of the OEM RIL commands.
***** IMPORTANT ***** This change requires the package to be signed using
a platform key and installation as a system app, or priv-app (kk4.4+), to
function correctly.

* Device functions moved into the Device class to provide all currently
used device details and future additions.

* SQLite Database methods updated and expanded to produce three
databases for each tracking method (Cell, Location & Signal Strength).

* Tracking methods updated to log each individual method correctly, and
Cell tracking updated to capture only unique cell entities.

* XML Database Export added which will export all data into individual
xml files.

* Framework & Telephony class files added to all access to hidden methods
and initial dabblings with reflection added to begin the process of
serial modem communication using RIL methods.

* Samsung Service Mode OEM Ciphering Indicator methods added which provide
the Ciphering Indicator details through this method. (Only tested on GT-i9100)

* Code formats updated were possible to closer match the Android guidelines.

Possibly more...

Minimum Android SDK version reduced to SDK 9 - Gingerbread to target a wider range of devices,
a number of code changes were required to comply with the SDK 9 level requirements.

Further changes made to the ATRilHook class in an attempt to access the invokeOemRilRequestStrings method
correctly, also some updates made to the handling of OemRilRaw requests and their response. Method currently
displays the Ciphering Indicator provided through the SamsungServiceMode methods which unfortunately would
probably be specific to Samsung devices (testing required). Currently investigating the layout of the byte[]
layout to enable further access to these functions and a greater understanding of what the Raw request expects.

Mapviewer updated although an issue still exists when the location table is empty causing a NPE when trying to
overlay stored locations onto the Map, this is currently being worked on to correct this issue.
