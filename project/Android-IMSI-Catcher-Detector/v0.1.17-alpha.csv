Added a basic custom map marker info window to display extended details of markers
added from either tracked locations or OpenCellID data. Further enhancements to this
will be made to provide supporting information for map markers.

Refactored a number of methods that support OpenCellID processing and requests into
the Helpers class to enable unified use of these methods across any part of the
application.

Current status of cell & location tracking is as follows:
- Enabling Cell Tracking (Only Option) requires GPS enabled to provide location
details for the cell.
- Currently as no other method has been tested the GPS lat/lng coordinates are used
to populate both tables (Cell & Location) until another method is confirmed to work
as required to provide the exact CELL LOCATION to be used within the Cell tracking
table.
- GPS location changes will only be tracked if more then 10 metres change in location
has been registered.

Other minor updates including additional logic checks added to all functions that
request SIM variables to ensure the sim state is ready.
