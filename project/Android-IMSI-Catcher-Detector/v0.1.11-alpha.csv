Cell Tracking consolidated to include the following PhoneStateListeners:
- Cell Location (LAC, CID etc)
- Signal Strength (GSM & CDMA/EVDO)
- Data State
- Data Activity

Cell Tracking preference added and enabled by default to automatically track Cell Information.

Signal Strength tracking has been removed as this is now provided through the Cell Tracking
system, all references have been removed including menus, Map & Db Viewers etc.

DISCLAIMER ACCEPTANCE REQUIRED
Activity will now force acceptance as requested in Github issue, if the user does not accept
the disclaimer then both the service and activity will exit and the Package Manager will be
invoked prompting to uninstall AIMSICD. If cancelled then the disclaimer will again appear
and the process will repeat until either accepted or the application uninstalled.

Map Viewer updates including preference persistance and the automatic loading of existing
OpenCellID data with details included in the popup, this will be extended shortly with a
custom Info Window to provide a better display of identified cell details. Logic reworked for
initial location gathering which should now hopefully allow for the three tier system to
work correctly.

Main menu updated to only display FemtoCell detection on CDMA devices only.
