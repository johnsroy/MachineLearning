Added missing resources for Actionbar icons which I had initially only added for HDPI devices,
all other defined display types have been added.

MapView updated to check for Google Play Services so no FC's are experienced by people who do not
use these services, added option to select map type and extended the details the system will apply
to the map including markers for unique CellID's found and signal overlays.

MapView will now default to last known location (if one is available) or will zoom to the last
loaded location found in the tracking database, other map controls enabled to allow gesture
control.

GeoLocation class added from paper written by Jan Philip Matuschek found here -
http://janmatuschek.de/LatitudeLongitudeBoundingCoordinates
This provides an equation to determine a bounding radius of a given point, for example
a cirle 50 miles/kilometres around a given location.

The reasoning behind this is to allow these calcuations to be performed so external API's
such as the one offered by OpenCellID.org can be utilised to provide known CellID and tower
locations which could be enabled within MapView.

Preference change is now detected correctly by the application showing immediate changes to
through the persistant notification for system status (Idle, Good & Alarm).

FEMTOCELL DETECTION ACTIVATED (Requires testing on CDMA devices)
Femtocell detection has been enabled for initial testing (CDMA devices ONLY) this must be enabled
through the menu and I will extend the preferences to enable the auto start option for detection
and also implement the evasive action preference to enable Airplane mode if detected with a
customisible automatic reset time period or manual control.

Preference added to kill the background service when quitting the application.

CDMA specific updates to include further details such as System ID, Base Station ID, Network ID and Longitude/Latitude.

Main layout updated to display device specific information.

Downloading of OpenCellID data will display markers for identified cell towers and their CellID
within 100km of the current location, this is basically to test functionality of this API full
data provided by OpenCellID is: lat,lon,mcc,mnc,lac,cellid,averageSignalStrength,samples,changeable

This functionality could be easily applied to different APIs offered by other organisations,
this could be helpful when comparing existing cell data to confirmed information (how accurate??)
to assist in making a decision regarding IMSI Catcher detection.

CSV file of details is stored on external storage along with the database table export files,
further options can be included to load any found details when the MapViewer is loaded.
