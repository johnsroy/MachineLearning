Method getAllCellInfo is encountering an unknown CellInfo type whilst parsing the
results returned by this method, which is a little strange.

Removed the throw and inserted a log to display the error but also provide more details
around what type of CellInfo is being encountered which may help to address this in a
more suitable fashion.

Corrected the RequestTask class to correctly show the progress bar for downloading of
OpenCellID data, contentlength method was returning -1 as filesize of the download
is unknown so the maximum size of the progress bar was being set to that value
resulting in the progress bar no displaying anything.
