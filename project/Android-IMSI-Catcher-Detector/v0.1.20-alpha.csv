Massive revamp of the UI for the application I know that this was not a priority
but I actually got quite sick of having to swipe between pages when testing stuff so
decided to change to the newer drawer style UI.

We can customise this further with an image at the top etc and jazz it up a bit more
and it also fits better with the current style of most other newer Android apps.

I hope you all like this style please let me know what you all think.

User preference selection of the application refresh rate has now been implemented
into the Device Information & Cell Information fragments, each will refresh the
displayed information as per the preference selection.

The timer handler will only be active when a fragment is visible (attached) and will
remove its callback when the fragment is paused, destroyed or detached.

I have set the current automatic refresh rate to 15 seconds but this can be changed
if anybody believes a different value would be more suitable.

Re-added the CMD Processor functions to support root terminal functions, associated
helpers and System Property value retrieval methods.

This is to support the AT Command Injection via the device terminal as discovered by @E3V3A

Corrected the list that stores neighbouring cell information so this should now reflect
the correct contents of the neighbouring cells. Cell ID was not being passes correctly
to the Cell class so would not have been displaying a correct value.

Modified the layout for the neighbouring cells so they display now using the Card UI style and allow scrolling of the details.

Slight fix to the onDestory method which should address the NPE some devices had
when the service was destroyed.

NPE caused by null location returned during loadEntries method and this correction
addresses that issue.

Also added method to the service to return the Mobile Country Code (MCC) so reference
to the telephony manager did not need to be initialised within the Map Viewer.

First thing you need to do before using this is give a BIG THANK YOU to @E3V3A (E:V:A
on xda) for determining how this implementation was possible because without his
perseverance this would not be possible!

ROOT IS REQUIRED!!

Root terminal methods are used to execute the AT Command Injection so this fragment
will check for both ROOT (su binary) and BUSYBOX to confirm both are available on
your device, if not the execution section of the fragment WILL NOT DISPLAY.

If the initial setup works correctly the next step is trying to determine your Ril
Serial Device through the system property ril.libargs if this is successful then
you are in business and the AT Command Injection system is available for you to test.

This will probably NOT WORK on many devices (such as my i9100) but it will provide
details of the failure if available and display them to the screen but also write them
to the file error.txt in the AIMSICD directory of your external storage.

Have fun and try not to break anything.
