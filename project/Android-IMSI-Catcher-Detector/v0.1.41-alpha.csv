Noticed that if OCID doesn't contain a PSC value for cells, the app sets PSC to
`666` in the database. Most places will display 'invalid' but that's not
translateable.

Refactored the validation method to Cell as static and use it to display the
i18n'd string 'Unknown' which I feel best conveys when a PSC would be out-of-
bounds.

Future work should translate unknown string for all langs and use it instead of
the `invalid` string literal.

Pull request #798, solving #794, fails to account for fresh installs & newly
booted phones where the service is not instantiated/running by the time the
menu is created for the first time and a NPE occurs.

If the service is null, simply choose 'false' since without a service there is
no way tracking is happening.

Added `onPrepareOptionsMenu` implementation that will redraw the checkboxes
depending on the latest truth every time the menu is open. Not sure if this is
unnecessary.
