This should fix #558.

Resolved issues:
- `CellTracker#setNotification()` always fires when `CellTracker#compareLac(CellLocation)` is called since recovering from a dangerous state should update the notification. Aka from MEDIUM to OK
- `RequestTask` provides a listener interface for completion callbacks so `Helpers#getOpenCellData(...)` fires OCID check on success
- Timeout for OCID download increased from default 10 seconds to 60 seconds, since the OCID API is slow as hell.
- If OCID API times out, we display that to the user as a special error message.

The listener callback interface is a bit crude, but is better than having RequestTask do too much.
