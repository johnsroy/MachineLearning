Massive update of UI with the implementation of swipe controlled Fragments, allowing
for a better display providing quick access to functions in place of having to select
menu items.

Currently the Device Information & Database Viewer are shown in this manner and the
next item that will be added is Advanced Cell Details including Neighbouring Cell
information and extended cell details.

Once the Cell details is added then the Samsung specific OEM_HOOK_RAW methods will also
be added allowing display of the Ciphering Indicator and other items.

Also initial code has been added to support user defined update intervals to allow
control over update frequency which will be fully implemented shortly.

Some devices do no hold the line number on the sim so throw an NPE when calling the
getLine1Number method, this will stop the NPE and crash where this occurs and will
then attempt to draw the Subscriber ID instead.
