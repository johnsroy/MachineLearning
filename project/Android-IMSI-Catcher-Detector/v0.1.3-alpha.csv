Actionbar menu has been applied removing the old menu style and adding a more up to date solution
that can be easily extended and modified, resources added from the Android provided Actionbar
icon sets for graphical representation of the tracking of cell, signal and location.

Device class was rewritten as a non-static class which resulted in a number of changes being made
to other classes to take this into account, this should have really been the way I initially wrote
this class but oh well it is better now :)

Screenshot of the Action bar changes can be found here: http://i57.tinypic.com/i2lw60.png

Added Persistant Notification which at present just displays the Phone Type (GSM/CDMA), but this
will eventually provide the immediate and visual notification of the phone status regarding
encryption/ciphering status and possibly Femtocell connections.

Added dialog to prompt to enable Location Services if Location Tracking is enabled but Location is not, settings fragment will be displayed to enable location services.

Cleaned up a little but of the code from my previous commit, coffee helps sharpen the mind a
little of this Windows developer and Android/Java moments of enlightenment can occur :)

Added GPLv3 license headers to class files.
