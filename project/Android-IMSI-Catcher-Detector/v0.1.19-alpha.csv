Sms Broadcast receiver modified to look for true TYPE 0 Stealth Sms messages,
processing is now done within the PDU checking the first byte value of each received
message. If the first byte == 0x40 then as per 3GPP TS 23.040 9.2.3.9 a TYPE 0 message
has just been intercepted.

Unable to test this function as I have no ability to issue a true TYPE 0 Sms but I
believe other contributes are able to test this fully.

Updated the service to disable the notification alert once the application becomes
visible to address the issue of the alert persisting.

Added additional check for Message type indicator & the TP-PID value so if mti == 0
or TP-PID == 0x40 then we have a Silent TYPE 0 Sms.

Additional check added as framework seems to use both in different places.

Corrected bug with async task calling UI methods during doInBackground modified
associated classes and methods to move all UI based calls into the onPostExecute
method. This corrects the issue with the database backup and restore functions.

Modified the MapViewer location logic as it was incorrectly trying to use the
getMyLocation method which does not return any data. Also added a Local Broadcast
Receiver to handle updated OpenCellID data and ensure map markers reflect any new
data received.

Cell class added to support modified API neighbouring cell data and simplify
operations with this.

Updated the Android API version of Neighbouring Cell information as this was broken
with one of my last updates, hopefully this now restores that functionality.

Unfortunately I can not test this as my device (Samsung i9100) does not return any
data for either of these methods (Known Issue).

The CDMA specific location method did not work and I somehow missed this reference

These methods and any calls have now been totally removed.
