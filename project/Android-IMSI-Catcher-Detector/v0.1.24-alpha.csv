To prepare correctly for contribution to the OpenCellID project the Cell data table
has been updated to include a number of fields that can be provided to OpenCellID
which include the following: Accuracy of reading, speed at time of reading, bearing at time of reading, Mcc, Mnc and string description of network type.

These major changes have required an upgrade of the database version to enable the
new table structure to be rebuild and as the changes are drastic it will NOT BE
POSSIBLE to restore any previous data.

Neighbouring cell methods have been rewritten to being improving the neighbouring cell
functions, the getAllCellInfo method has been corrected in a number of it's uses
including within the neighbouring cells method.

Further testing is required to confirm what network types return what data as UTMS I
believe will only return the PSC and RSSI whilst other networks will return the CID,
this update should at least bring the display of information to all devices which will
be improved and corrected much quicker now I can actually see the details on my new
device.

Tweaks to the Device & Service to address a number of small bugs and NPEs in isolated
cases.

Initial implementation for detection method 1 to compare the CID & LAC with the Cell
Information Table contents as an initial implementation for detection of a changed LAC,
once OCID issues (API key use etc) have been finalised this detection method can be
extended to include checking of external data.

This initial implementation is activated through the drawer menu item titled
'Monitor Cell Information' which will invoke timed runnable that will poll the Cell
Location details using the selected refresh rate OR default to 25 seconds if
Automatic/Manual has been selected, once testing is complete this can be enabled as a
passive detection method which can could be controlled through a user preference.

As I have no real way of testing this I require testing by other project members who
do have access to equipment or an environment where a changing LAC can be simulated
thus confirming the accuracy of this implementation.

Presently this will only invoke the MEDIUM threat level through the notification and
does not fully implement the capturing and score based method as per the issue details
once further testing is complete the alert and tracking of information can be refined.

releases.

confirmed.

This also forces the user to either enable GPS or cancel the dialog box

Modifed the OpenCellID methods to only operate if an API Key has been
entered through the application settings, enabling each user to request
and use their own keys.

This will need to be extended once functionality has been confirmed to
provide more instruction to users regarding the registration process,
such as through alert dialogs and details regarding the OCID website etc.

Key is stored on the device and only used when initiating communication
with the OCID servers, as with all previous versions no personal
information is sent to OCID only necessary cell/location information as
required by their API methods.

is no GPS lock and the users location can not be determined through
