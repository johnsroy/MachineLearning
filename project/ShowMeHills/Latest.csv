* Prepare merged BIH + OSM database using distance between peaks to determine whether to delete the OSM peak or not.
* Include instructions on how to carry out this merge using Oracle (I wouldn't know how to do the same in MySQL so someone experienced in that might want to have a go and document the steps).
* Add a few log entries for when DB copy takes place.
* Increment DB version from 8 to 9 and vacuum to minimize DB file size.

* Fix labels disappearing when only height display is enabled.
* Extract methods from onDraw() to clarify sub-tasks.
* Introduce constants to ease testing and pave the way for a configurable minimum text size.
* Increase minimum alpha and font size to make distant hills just about readable.
* Continue populating hills even if we've reached the minimum font size; allows more hills to be displayed.
