to change the Java package names to match.

Also updated Maven POM's to use com.github.github as the group id - again,

Sadly the bizarre compilation errors still occur when trying to make
GitHubAuthenticatorActivity indirectly extend FragmentActivity:

ERROR] /home/roberto/github/github-android-parent/github-android/src/main/java/com/github/mobile/android/authenticator/GitHubAuthenticatorActivity.java:[92,19] onCreateOptionsMenu(android.view.Menu) in com.github.mobile.android.authenticator.GitHubAuthenticatorActivity cannot override onCreateOptionsMenu(android.view.Menu) in android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity; overridden method is final
[ERROR] /home/roberto/github/github-android-parent/github-android/src/main/java/com/github/mobile/android/authenticator/GitHubAuthenticatorActivity.java:[99,19] onOptionsItemSelected(android.view.MenuItem) in com.github.mobile.android.authenticator.GitHubAuthenticatorActivity cannot override onOptionsItemSelected(android.view.MenuItem) in android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity; overridden method is final

...so GitHubAuthenticatorActivity still simply extends RoboAccountAuthenticatorActivity
rather than RoboAccountAuthenticatorFragmentActivity and can't show the
ActionBar. The compilation problem (which is incorrect so far as I can
tell, the overridden methods are *not* final) will hopefully go away with
ABS 4, as that version is slated to remove the custom, patched version
of the compatibility library.

It's kinda interesting how the test was broken by this innocuous change:

https://github.com/github/android/commit/65348dd

The change is that the 'getRepositories()' method is no longer used in
the main app (replaced by 'getOrgRepositories()'), and so is stripped by
proguard, but it's still used in the integration test. With recent
changes to the android-maven-plugin, the contributing library is only
processed by proguard once, so the explicit usage in the integration
tests isn't enough to get the 'getRepositories()' method kept - an
explicit proguard rule has to be added.

The Beam API calls are wrapped in the 'Beam' class, so that the
classloaders of earlier devices don't throw exceptions.

To get Beam to work, you need to specify in your activity code that
you're going to broadcast a Beam message, and in your manifest that
your activity is interested in receiving particular Beam messages. We
filter here by specifying the 'application/vnd.github.repo.issue+json'
mime type for messages.

The integration test exposed an interesting bug in robotium - if you
decide to skip the body of a test (eg because beam isn't available for
the device under test), the teardown method will hang on the robotium
method finishOpenedActivities() - it has a lethal little loop that
doesn't die:

This fix switches the implementation of AvatarHelper (which used the
'tag' field of the ImageView for tracking loaded updates) to use
https://github.com/rtyley/lazy-drawables (which uses a custom drawable
that updates itself to the same end).

some other small improvements:

* keys off gravatar id rather than the avatar_url supplied by the GitHub
api. This allows us to show avatars against commits, even though those
commits may have been made by people who aren't GitHub users, and allows
us to use the same pool of avatar images for both
* avatar images in the in-memory cache are pre-scaled to the right size
for the ImageView, which saves the android platform from having to do it
whenever the avatar is re-used - helps performance on scrolling thru big
lists
* uses streaming on download to avoid allocating a full byte array for
the compressed image data
* does a bit more work (decompressing image data) on the non-UI thread,
to avoid jerkiness

also closes #5

The default implementation of lazy-drawables storage is to cache to the

not going to have db queries constructed on them.

Because our avatar file store is in the app's 'cache' folder we also get
a couple of nice things for free: the folder will be automatically
cleared by the operating system if disk space is tight, which is better than
us swelling a database file which can't be easily shrunk by the OS. The
android platform also gives the user the option to clear an apps cache
on the 'manage app' page - the user can use this as a brute-force
method to refresh their avatars.

The problem with making sure the user is authenticated is that getting
them to sign in is a process that will block, so you can't reasonably
expect anything that occurs on the main thread to have a guaranteed
reference to authenticated GitHub credentials.

Fortunately, when people are doing network access it *has* to be on a
background thread. We can enforce that these background threads have
required the user to login, so at the point of executing the api
request, we will have credentials and can set them on the request.

Implementation-wise the important classes for this change are
AuthenticatedUserLoader & AuthenticatedUserTask, which enforce
that the user must be signed in before the rest of their background
threads run, LateAuthenticatedGitHubClient which only attempts to read
the GitHub credentials immediately before making it's API request
(which is implicitly on the background thread) and GitHubAccountScope,
a custom Guice scope used by the async loader/task classes to ensure
that the user is logged in and to make those GitHubAccount credentials
available for injection.

This commit also improves the background android-account sync in that
it now respects the account supplied to onPerformSync().

This changes the implementation of RecentReposHelper to base it off a

I think this'll make it easier to add repos to the recently used-list
when spontaneously viewing repos without an explicit User/Org context,
and would make generating an overall list of most-recently viewed repos
easier if one was required.

The list of recently viewed repos help is now longer, at a maximum of 20
items, but only 5 'recently viewed' repos are displayed in each Org
context - the extra is to ensure that viewing 5 or more repos in one Org
context doesn't completely deplete the recent-repos in another.

This just pages through the Orgs and checks that the repo list updates
to show at least one repo name known to be in the selected org. I've
added this test because I recently unwittingly broke the Org switcher
with 6708c75- the associated code is fragile and I'd like to make sure I
don't break it again! I'm a little concerned that the integration test
itself might be rather brittle but time will tell on that front...

This commit includes a tweak to cope with pre-ICS Spinner by ABS:
Instead of android.widget.Spinner, ABS uses
'com.actionbarsherlock.internal.widget.IcsSpinner' for the actionbar
dropdown on pre-ICS devices, so the integration test was failing to find
the dropdown on pre-ics devices.

Switch back to using a text view with custom spans to display

API v3 is slight massaged to remove certain elements and slightly
alter padding and whitespace.

This brings back the Html and HttpImageGetter classes but
adds further support for supporting tags not currently

presents complexity since holders have to do the bookkeeping

being run once per view holder.

Moving this to the adapter allows it to be computed once
and reset when the items change and doesn't require storing
state between all the holders.

The new pattern is to create an ItemView extension that exposes
public final fields for each view element that get updated and
then the list adapter will contain the logic on how the view
should be updated.
