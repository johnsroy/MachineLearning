DeadObjectException is thrown if the callback is invalid (has died). The callback should thus be set to 'null' or we'll get an infinite series of exceptions :-)

Do not try to unbind forever if the backend died (e.g. DeadObjectException).

Currently reinstalling an active backend may result in infinite exception spamming as dead backends are marked 'bound' and can never unbind (IllegalArgumentException).

Make only one try to unbind.
