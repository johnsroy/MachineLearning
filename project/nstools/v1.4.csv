write result to prop file instead of directly to xml pref
then in MainActivity read that prop file and write to xml pref
we need to do this because we dont want another config overwritten
by this script

VoltageControlActivity:
max_arm_volt and max_int_volt already read by read_ns_tweak.sh
so we change readVoltages method

NSTweakActiviy:
reload xml preferences in method reloadPreferences
