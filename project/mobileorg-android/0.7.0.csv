When SDCard sync mode is selected, the synchronizer does not actually
copy any files off the SDCard, even if 'internal' storage mode is
selected. When OrgFileParser attempts to read from the internal
storage location, there is no file to open, resulting in a
NullPointerException during synchronization.

This change ensures that OrgFileParser will read the files directly
from the SDCard whenever SDCard synchronization is selected,
regardless of storage mode.
