+ add ActionBar spinner (dropdown) navigation
+ merge Activity and ListFragment into ListActivity (it made sense to separate them earlier, but now it's pointless)
+ add ActionBar color and icon change depending on distro selected
+ use Android-MultiStateListView instead of normal ListView
- temporarily broke ActionBar icons
- ugly design (for now)
+ support for multiple distros (not all working; added Arch, Debian, Gentoo and Parabola for now)
+ put all feed URLs into urls.xml instead of having them in the code
- remove reload button in error view in the ListView, may be re-added later if somebody requests it
= change application name from LinuxNews to Linux News
