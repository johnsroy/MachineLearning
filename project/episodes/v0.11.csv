Since somebody else uploaded this application to the play store without
changing the applicationId, it needs to be changed for me to release it
on the play store. I do not want to completely change it, however, as
that would be disruptive to F-Droid and existing users.

Add a gradle productFlavor called 'playstore' that builds with the
applicationId 'com.vindustries.epsiodes'. And one called 'fdroid' that
builds with the old id 'org.jamienicol.episodes'. Ensure that the
content provider uses the correct applicationId, meaning both versions
can be installed at the same time.

New versions of the support library don't like it if windowActionBar is
set to false without setting windowNoTitle to true. So set that to
appease it.

Create new fragment NextEpisodeFragment, which is just like
EpisodeDetailsFragment but instead of being given a specific episode id,
it is given a show id and displays the next unwatched episode.

This should be refactored to share code with NextEpisodeFragment rather
than duplicate it.

show and hide not the fragment's view, but its direct child which holds
everything else. this means that when the next episode fragment is the
current page in show activity you can still scroll it up and down (to
collapse the header image). This also ensures that the checkbox is
invisible before the data is loaded, without treating the checkbox
differently to the other items. Do this for both NextEpisodeFragment and
EpisodeDetailsFragment.
