also has the primary colour as its background so they form a single

large white text.

Remove the title from the toolbar as it is no longer required. Make the
tabs no longer expand to the entire width as it now looks better when
they don't.

instead of having the toolbar at the top of the activity and

this means it is always opaque rather than being transparent then
turning opaque when scrolled up.

compiled from recent source, not in the play store version.)
