Was concerned about 'starring' shows as favourites, because this is
for shows to be sorted first because they are currently being watched,
not because they are all-time favourites. But the word pinned isn't
clear either, and we have star icons available. The word star should be
fine as long as the word favourite isn't also used.

Version 1 databases and new databases will be upgraded or created
properly. Databases which had a pinned column already will break.

it doesn't work now that starred shows are sorted above unstarred.
a custom indexer could probably be implemented sometime in the future,
but for now better just to not have one.

in the list of shows, have section headers to seperate the starred and
unstarred shows. Makes it obvious why shows being starred are sorted
above unstarred before sorting alphabetically, otherwise that might
be confusing. Only show the headers if there are both starred and
unstarred shows.

ActionBarCompat from the support library v7. Fixes #10.
Bump build and target sdk version to 18 and include newest support
libraries.

Min sdk version should be able to be lowered to 7. But the shows list
item and seasons list item layouts aren't working, so keep at 8.

On old API versions the activity title can't be set properly. This
will be fixed in a later release of the compatibility libraries:
