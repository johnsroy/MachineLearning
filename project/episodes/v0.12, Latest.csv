Add language parameter to tvdb.Client.getShow() and send it to tvdb. If
null, fall back to 'en', so as to not break anything.

When adding a new show, pass the language along with tvdb id and name in
the intent to AddShowService, which will pass it getShow().

When refreshing a show already in the database, first query the database
for the language as we currently do for the tvdb id, then pass it to getShow().

And simply ignore the other ones. This looks better than displaying each
language as a different show. But the downside is that the user cannot
choose which language to add the show in. In the future we should find a
way to allow the user to do that.

Not doing this meant that when adding or refreshing a show, the returned
language was null. This meant that we were always inserting null into
the database as the show's language. That lead to the show's data
reverting to english (or disappearing if the show has no english data on
tvdb) upon first refresh.
