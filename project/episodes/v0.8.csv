Add a new activity SettingsActivity which simply contains an instance of
another new fragment SettingsFragment. Add a menu item to the main
activity to open the settings activity. Slight code cleanup in
MainActivity while we're there.

Add the following settings:
* Automatically refresh shows - a checkbox that enables or disables
auto-refresh. Defaults to checked.

* Auto-refresh frequency - selects the frequency at which the shows are
automatically refreshed. Can be set to the following options:
* Daily
* Twice weekly
* Weekly
* Fortnightly
Defaults to weekly.
The constants associated with these strings are periods not
frequencies, so the variables are named as such. The user-facing
strings refer to them as frequencies.
Only enabled if 'automatically refresh shows' is checked.

This commit only adds these settings, it doesn't implement the
functionality.

Bump minSdkVersion to 11, for PreferenceFragment, as it unfortunately
doesn't exist in the support library.

Create a singelton class AutoRefreshHelper. Make it read and listen to
changes in the settings regarding auto-refresh. When auto-refresh is
enabled schedule a service to run after roughly a certain time, and when
auto refresh is disabled cancel that service. Use AlarmManager to do
this. Use the value of the auto-refresh frequency setting, along with
the time of the last auto-refresh, to determine what time to run the
service at.

The service itself is responsible for refreshing all of the shows,
storing the time at which it last did so, and asking the helper to
schedule it again.

Using the AlarmManager was chosen over using a SyncAdapter for a few
reasons:
* We do not use accounts, and adding a dummy one to the system--like
the SyncAdapter approach required--looked very strange.
* I believe it will be easier to add an 'only auto-refresh over Wi-Fi'
option in the future using this approach.
* I don't think a SyncAdapter's periodic sync works correctly when it
is toggled on/off or the phone reboots. So part of the chosen
approach (storing the time of last refresh) would have had to be
implemented anyway.

If the backup folder is empty then a message saying so is displayed

There is no protection against selecting any random file that isn't a

obviously will not result in any valid data being restored: effectively
the data will be cleared.
