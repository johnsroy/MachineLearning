Create package org.jamienicol.nextepisode.tvdb for TVDB related code.
Add to it a class Client as the main interface. Its constructor
requires an API key. It has a function searchShows which takes a string
query, and returns a list of SearchResult objects. SearchResult is a
simple class which stores data about results from show searches:
currently the show's ID, name, and overview description.

Create a class SearchResultParser to extract SearchResult objects from
the response. Uses a SAX XML parser with the android.sax utility classes
to help do this.

No proper error handling yet, just logs the message and returns null if
any exceptions are thrown. This needs improved.
No UI to accompany this yet, just the backend.
