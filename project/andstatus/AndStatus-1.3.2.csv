Moreover, the same '(close to the) Guaranteed message delivery' approach works for the other commands also: Timeline reload, 	Favorites creation and deletion.
AndTweet retries to send commands to the server on every automatic update and during any manual command or message (Reload or Status update). User is being notified about number of messages currently in the queue (If Notifications are being enabled).

Two (location) permissions were removed,	one permission was added to help asynchronous message delivery (ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE).
