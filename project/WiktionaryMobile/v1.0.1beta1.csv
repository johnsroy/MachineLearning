Pulls in jQuery and a stub of MediaWiki's JavaScript front-end APIs covering Map and Message classes.

Code can call mw.msg() or mw.message() to fetch localized messages, passing a key and parameters etc. mw.msg() returns a string, while mw.message() returns a Message object, offering a subset of MediaWiki's PHP Message class <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Localisation#Using_messages> <http://svn.wikimedia.org/doc/classMessage.html#_details>

Use of the object form is recommended because it makes it much more explicit whether you're getting things for plaintext or for HTML (where you usually want to make sure escapes of special characters get applied). Say for this message:
{'error-loading-page': 'Error loading page '$1''}

You might need plain text for some purposes like an alert dialog:

alert(mw.message('error-loading-page').params(pageTitle).plain());

Or you might need to put it into HTML output and make sure it's escaped:

out += '<li>' + mw.message('error-loading-page').params(pageTitle).escaped() + '</li>';

This is VERY important to prevent code injection when working with an HTML-based interface!

Stub localization messages are in messages/messages-en.js; there's not yet infrastructure to load up other languages but this should be pretty straightforward. Descriptions of messages go into the messages-qqq.js file; this is very important to help translators figure out the context of what they're translating. A good place to explain parameter usage etc!

We may change from the .js files to something more standardy if that's easier to integrate with TranslateWiki.

Injects an event handler into the iframe's links after load.

This is imperfect; it might miss some links with funny classes, and I don't think it takes effect until after full page load so tapping too early might happen before the event handler gets put in.
Same problem affects the hiding of the mobile web UI elements as well, they may flash briefly while the page loads.

Todo: apparently the menu code doesn't check whether the page is already in bookmarks, so added a comment that instead of whining when a page is already in bookmarks it should change the menu item to 'remove from bookmarks'.

Todo: localization needed in bookmarking code.

The iframe on Android 2 expands to its full size, and we let the entire document scroll around on a fixed-expanded iframe.
But on Android 3 and 4, it defaults to a couple hundred px high and doesn't auto size to fit.

Switching things around to lay it out at a fixed size within the window would be preferable but as soon as you scroll *the iframe*, tapping in the iframe breaks -- tapping on links etc hits where things are without scroll, instead of where they are now.

For now, at load time I'm just stretching the iframe's height to match the internal document height. This works well enough until you expand some sections, at which point the document gets taller and things end up scrolling within the iframe and exploding again. Sigh.

But, at least things are visible. ;)

* switched <uses-library> manifest entry for Google Maps to indicate that it is not required -- this lets the app install and run on devices without the proprietary APIs.
* cleaner loading of the NearMeActivity class in the NearMePlugin, so we can catch a class lookup failure and return an error instead of crashing.
* added an alert() dialog on map loading failure, to indicate that yes you tried it but no it doesn't work.

The map view still loads on my Nexus One (without the actual maps, but I think that's because it needs a registered key to 'really' work).
On Kindle Fire, the app installs and runs and the map view triggers the error dialog and lets you back to where you were before.

Jenkins env variables are listed in its documentation:

aapt an not override versionName (nor versionCode) if it is set in the

Fixes several issues:
* no more clickthrough issues with scrolling & the floating search bar
* content area is now sized correctly on Android 4
* no longer tries to open random things in browsers on Android 4

Minor regression in error pages (need to fix styles).

Note that we know carry some content styles in wiki.css, which could require being kept up to date with core. It may be worth splitting styles out so we can import content styles that don't interfere with other UI -- needs to be more modular on the wiki/MobileFrontend side for this.

There may be some changes to styles in general, but it seems to be mostly fixed up.


With the divs it's also easier to integrate libraries like iscroll to manage scroll & zoom behavior; this works well on ICS with a fast phone but is too slow on Android 2.x on a Nexus One, so not yet integrating that full. Scrolling is still done on the whole document, with a position:fixed searchbar.

This works around the lack of overflow scrolling on iOS before version 5.

Adds chrome.doScrollHack() calls when creating/refreshing scrollable views; separated
the scrollable divs from their content to make it work better with iScroll.

iScroll is not used on Android (too slow on 2.x, not needed on 3/4) or iOS 5 (not needed).
Though could add it in later to support pinch zoom. :D

Earlier commit had changed the header on the settings screen to a <header> to match the others. For some reason, on Android 2.3.x this made the selects unselectable.
Undoing it keeps things working, as long as there are few enough items not to need to scroll. :)

It still leaves the 'close' box mispositioned on tablet mode, though, that may be fixable separately.

note changes [1] in the MobileFrontend mean that future versions of
the android app with the existing MobileFrontend dev code will break
as the onclick handlers are taken away and the wm_toggle_section function
is no longer public

this change ensures that MobileFrontend code is initialised after every
page load. There is two lines of code that remove any legacy code whilst
the changeover occurs.

note this change requires that you run make remotes so have updated README file

the jQuery ajax call only does an intelligent guess if no dataType
parameter is set. In network.js previously dataType was set to text
so we should respect that as the default to avoid breaking things
elsewhere. The search requests will need to ask for json to make sure
they get the expected json back (search is broken without this)
