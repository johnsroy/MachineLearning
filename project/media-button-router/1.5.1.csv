"1a0b51db69d82ff4e3edcdb5e549161afdc77eab","2011-12-26 14:17:27-05:00","More special logic for ICS. If we're on ICS and the selector is open, only send our custom intent in MediaButtonReceiver, and don't do anything else. This prevents the selector from being paused/resumed unnecessarily.

I need a better way to communicate somethings between the selector and the receiver besides shared preferences, but it's just so easy.

Based on change by PeterH with minor change by me to work better with pre ICS phones.

If I didn't do this, and the selector ever crashed, media button router would be hosed if the user didn't wipe data.
