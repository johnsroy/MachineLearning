* Filling buffer will ' ' (spaces) instead of null characters. Android's MONOSPACE font doesn't render the null correctly; might be trying to interpret them as unicode.  Was messing up indentation on rtorrent sessions.
* Removed SoftFont from redraw() and sped things up immensely. Everything seems to still render fine, was there a reason we needed the SoftFont?
* Corrected buffer.update[] handling so we aren't repainting entire screen each time; much faster now.
* Added OpenGL rendering by default, but doesn't change speed on emulator.

bitmap if provided.  a Console creates TerminalViews for each bridge while it is active, and handles panning back/forth between them.

* extended trilead library to support resizePTY() command
* left/right screen gestures will pan between various open consoles
* up/down screen gestures on right-half will look through scrollback buffer
* up/down screen gestures on left-half will trigger pageup/down keys

* broke ctrl+ keyboard mapping, will need to bring back over from older code
