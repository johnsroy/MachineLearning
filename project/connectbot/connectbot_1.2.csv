* Filling buffer will ' ' (spaces) instead of null characters. Android's MONOSPACE font doesn't render the null correctly; might be trying to interpret them as unicode.  Was messing up indentation on rtorrent sessions.
* Removed SoftFont from redraw() and sped things up immensely. Everything seems to still render fine, was there a reason we needed the SoftFont?
* Corrected buffer.update[] handling so we aren't repainting entire screen each time; much faster now.
* Added OpenGL rendering by default, but doesn't change speed on emulator.
