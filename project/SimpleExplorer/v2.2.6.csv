Changed onKeyDown() return from 'true' to a call to super. Fixes #41.
Test included.

Also added braces to a two-line conditional in the same method for
consistency with other conditionals, as well as to reduce risk of
introducing new bugs later.

Updated build.gradle to apply package name (applicationId) suffix to
debug builds in order to differentiate it from release builds.  This
facilitates installing and running both builds on a single device at
the same time, without interfering with each other.

Also included a version name suffix to debug builds for further
clarification.

Also included resources with a debug qualifier to apply a different
app name (English and Korean provided) and launcher icon to debug
builds for further differentiation in the launcher and settings.

This should make it easier for users to debug and compare behaviors
with release builds.

Bug in Theme.AppCompat (appcompat-v7:22.1.0 and appcompat-v7:22.1.1)
implements white, untinted AppCompat ActionMode icons in both Light
and Dark themes on pre-Lollipop devices, resulting in white-on-white
invisible icons in the Light theme.

Note that Lollipop devices seem to fall back to the platform theme
with correctly tinted icons, so they are unaffected by the bug.

This affects any Text Selection ActionMode, wherever a TextView or an
EditText has textIsSelectable enabled.  This includes RenameDialog,
CreateFileDialog, and CreateFolderDialog.

Implementing android.support.v7.AlertDialog for these dialogs is the
best long-term fix for the issue, but it has blocking bugs in the
current appcompat version.

Assigned existing light and dark holo icons for Select All, Cut, and
Copy to the corresponding Theme.AppCompat attributes in the two child
themes in styles.xml.  These can be removed when
android.support.v7.AlertDialog is fixed and implemented.

This provides visible icons in the Text Selection ActionMode on
pre-Lollipop devices, without affecting those on Lollipop.
