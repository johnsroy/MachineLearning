Just wanted to get a proof-of-concept going.  This currently fakes its
way through the authentication process, but there is no database storage
as of now so it's not practical yet.

Feel free to hack, slash, and delete at will.  =)  I've at least gotten
all the API error constants in and documented, and established a basic
dispatching method for processing requests.

Copy 2.0/, api/, and data/ directories to a PHP-capable server's root to
simulate the Last.FM experience.  The hosts file would need to alias
last.fm and ws.audioscrobbler.com, but I'm not bothering with that yet.

Files now include  ...vendor/autoload.php where needed and the
external_dependencies folder has been removed. The installation instructions
have been updated to reflect these changes. nixtape and gnukebox have separate
composer files to ease separate installation.
Feedback on this strategy is welcomed.

Use phpunit rather than simpletest for all tests. simpletest is no longer a
dependency.

Update to current versions of libraries. Where this has caused errors to be
logged (notably for templates) code has been changed to resolve them.
