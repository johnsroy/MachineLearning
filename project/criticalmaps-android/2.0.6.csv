The Marker class holds a static reference to a DefaultInfoWindow instance
which in turn holds a reference to the MapView. Thus it leaks the entire
view hierarchy when the fragment is detached.
Work around this by sub classing marker and implementing Overlay's
onDetach() method to null out the static references there.
Also move common initialization code to the subclass.

AsyncTasks must be started from the UI thread and as of JELLYBEAN this is automatically taken care of.
Since we're running it from a TimerTask - which is a separate thread - we have to take care of this ourselves
for devices running ICS and lower.
