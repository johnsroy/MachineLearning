When the softkeyboard has been opened at least once in the chat fragment,
it needs to be hidden on fragment change since the chat fragment is still
in a 'visible' state and the EditText keeps focus. As of now this is done
by hiding the keyboard whenever a new tab is selected. Unfortunately this
doesn't handle the case when the Activity is resumed via notification
since the EditText still gets the focus and therefore the keyboard is
opened again.
This patch works around this by making the parent Layout focusable and
removing focus from the EditText when leaving the chat fragment. Also only
do this when we're leaving the chat fragment.

Using System.exit() to is bad practice. In this specific case it prevents the service
from properly shutting down as stopService() is asynchronous. Therefore onDestroy()
is never executed, because the process has already been killed.
Instead of force-killing let Android do it's thing.

getRoad() will always query the osrm API for routing information. As this is
done on the main thread the app will be unresponsive. Additionally most queries
will fail because the generated URLs are too long. In consequence getRoad()
will fall back to generating the Road by only using the waypoints.
Since the raw waypoints are already precise enough and none of the additional
information is used, just construct the Road directly.

Fragments should only ever handle menu items that are fragment specific
and added by the fragment itself. Implementing the callbacks in a superclass
and thus instantiating them with every fragment can lead to all kinds of
weird behavior (see the sternfahrt checkbox state).

By default omsbonuspack markers open an info bubble onClick. This requires a
'bonuspack_bubble.xml' layout to be present, which is inflated on marker
instantiation. We don't have that, so every marker throws an exception.
Since the infowindow is not needed, handle this by adding a dummy layout and
by calling setInfoWindow(null) on every marker.

This makes it less likely that the process is killed by android due to memory pressure.
This also moves all the notification handling to the service and and makes sure the
notification is shown for the entire service lifecycle.
Note that there is no need to explicitly cancel the notification as this is automatically
taken care of when the service stops.
