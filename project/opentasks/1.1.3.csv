group headers. The quick add dialog provides a title field and a list
selector. There are buttons to save the new task and continue with
another one and to open the full blown editor.

In future we should add a way to provision the quick add dialog with
more values and allow to disable or hide the spinner. That way we can
use it to add sub tasks quickly or to add it to other group section
headers as well.

add quick add to the priorities list.
To make this work we also added a clone constructor to ContentSet and
fixed an issue with ArrayChoicesAdapter that showed an incorrect title
if a value is not among the visible choices.
