In the bufferlist, colors/other unprintable characters show as boxes.
Strip colors from the title, and modified stripColors to also strip
unprintable characters. This appears to fix the issue. Thanks R1cochet

Colors in a buffer title are not converted to weechat's internal color
scheme, so we need to strip IRC style colors from them.

Added method stripIRCColors to Color to suppor this.
Modified BufferListAdapter to call that method to clean the title for
display.
