Yay, the project is still alive!
A list of some of the changes(non-exhaustive):

* Dev build has a custom version banner now
* Don't change window title to match buffer(causes crashes and isn't
valuable)
* Big changes with how connections work(more abstract)
* Soft keyboard now has send button instead of enter
* Chat input box is now has better spellchecking/corrections
* Service now actually runs in the background(and survives android
trying to kill it)
* Fix various crashes
* Introduce other crashes(most likely)
