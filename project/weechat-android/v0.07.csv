stripColors wasn't working properly, so it has been reduced to a single
function that will take care of stripping or converting to html.  A
singleton is used to keep from instantiating new Color objects over and
over.

HTML only needs to be encoded if we are planning on using it as html, if
we just want to strip it we shouldn't encode the message.

Upon connecting, no longer retrieve MAXLINES for every buffer, instead,
get the list of lines the first time you visit a buffer.  Additionally,
don't subscribe to the nicklist changes unless the buffer is open.

BufferLine - Now has a unique pointer, so we can check for duplicate
lines when adding them.  This prevents a request for the same line
resulting in it appearing twice.

RelayService - Add subscribeBuffer/unsubscribeBuffer functions to get
the list of lines and the nicklist on demand

Update version string to v0.07-dev
Update loading please wait message

Fix bug in BufferListAdapter where the contents were being modified
outside the UI thread leading to a crash.(If buffer was opened/closed
while looking at the buffer list, it would crash)

Sync buffer/nicklist updates all the time. Attempting to sync only
buffer updates and then subscribing to nicklist when needed did not seem
to work(Weechat Bug?)

Observers should be notified after the number of unread messages has
been updated, so they can reset it if they'd like. Prior to this change,
if you were in a buffer, a line was added, and you went back to the
buffer list, you would see a 1 for unread messages.

If there is no network available, then the InetAddress.getByName will
fail, leaving server = null.  This then causes a NullPointerException
when the Socket goes to use it. Modified how the server variable is
handled in order to fix this.

Also modified RelayConnection so that a handler can only be added once
for a specific message.  This should prevent the bufferManager receiving
multiple callbacks once the connection is restored.

The method of dealing with an Upgrade is to just disconnect, wait a few
moments, and then reconnect.  Should work for most situations.

This fixed a few bugs in LineHandler(where the buffer might not exist
anymore).

Also modified RelayConnection to allow message ID's that have no object
attached to them(in this case, the _upgrade, and _upgrade_ended
messages.
