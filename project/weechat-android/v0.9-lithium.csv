The issue with the title not updating during swiping between different

Fixes #64.

In the bufferlist on a tablet, there is no title for the channel
available.  Since we sometimes try to set the visibility of the buffer
title, this was causing NPEs and crashing.

This bug is only present in 08-dev-b4.

Sometimes when you return to the app, if the background service has
died(or crashed), when it restarts bufferManager will be empty, and a
NPE will occur when the app tries to show the buffer.  Check that we are
connected first before trying to retrieve the buffer.

This was fixed based on a crash report in the google play developer
console, so not all details regarding it are present.

No longer crash when closing a buffer and then switching between the
remaining open ones.
Properly closes buffers so that we don't end up showing the 'closed'
buffers contents due to caching in the FragmentStatePager.

This preference will only work properly on weechat 0.4.1-dev compiled
after 2/3/2013 due to a bug in weechat core. If enabled on versions
prior to this buffers will not be updated when open.

Due to a secondary bug, notification is given for buffers opened when at
least one buffer is open in the client.  If no buffers are open, then
notifications for new buffers will not be received.  Additionaly,
_upgrade messages from the server will be missed as well.

Added a preference_long_summar.xml to res/layouts to allow for
preference items with more than a 2 line summary.
