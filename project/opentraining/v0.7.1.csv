The bug concerned the line:

if(mExercise.getExerciseSource().equals(ExerciseSource.CUSTOM))

As an NullPointerException has been raised either mExercise or the exercise source was null.
Unfortunatelly I could not reproduce this bug, but at least the app should no longer crash at this point.
I'll close #32 for now, but nevertheless something still seems to be wrong.

The crash occured when you:
- have used a workout before (so there were training entries)
- added a new exercise and
- wanted to continue your last training

As the new exercise had no history/training entries the app would crash later when trying to access the training entry.

Instead of a specific icon the first exercise image will be displayed as 'icon'.
This is not the perfect solution as the memory consumption may be too high.

This is done by the usage of the library ACRA.
Crash reports will now be send to a php script that will send the report via email to me.
I also added a dialog for sending feedback (about wrong exercises).
