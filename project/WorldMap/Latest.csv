I start the app with:

Intent intent = new Intent(this, ImageViewerActivity.class);
intent.setAction(android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
intent.setDataAndType(Uri.fromFile(new File(info.getLocation())), 'image/png');
startActivity(intent);

However, there is a corner zoom bug which goes away after the user pans or zooms for the first time.  To fix this.  The suggested code fixes the problem.

This eliminates some artifacts caused by drawing on top of the previous image.
The sampler drawer can have this line as well.
