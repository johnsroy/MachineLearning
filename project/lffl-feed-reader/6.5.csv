Implement custom feeds right-to-left drawer layout (please use RSS 2.0
feedburner format)

Thanks to a dynamic list, and a fab button which will autohide when list
is scrolling, it is possible now to add all the feeds You want. Feeds
will be stored inside an sqlite database and saved on memory.
Furthermore You can also delete them from the list

- Resources clean
