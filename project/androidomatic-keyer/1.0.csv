* Pushing 'play' button causes new soundThread (containing new AudioTrack) to be created and executed.

* soundThread does the work of pushing audio into AudioTrack's buffer while AudioTrack plays.

* soundThread also polls to see if UI thread wants it to stop.  If asked to stop, it shuts off
AudioTrack and commits suicide.

* still To-Do:  make soundThread notice when message is done playing, then kill self gracefully.
