There were cyclic dependency issues with AbstractBrowserActivity
depending on an interface defined in sub-classes of itself. Move the
interfaces to their own files to fix the issues.

Update the .gitignore file to ignore Android Studio outputs.

Reddit wants apps to use the phrase '..for reddit', so the name,
'reddit by brian', will no longer suffice. Change it to 'rbb'.

- Promote share button a bit so that it does not overlap the overflow
menu on phones.

- Put sort comments in the overflow menu to prevent some jank when
switching from links to comments in no account mode.

- Put new comments in the overflow menu as well since sharing and
starring is probably more common.

Giving up on getting the ShareActionProvider to work with split action
bar so just use the normal share intent. It seems to handler for the
share intent has changed to be more convenient, so I think this is OK.
