Stop using a format string, since it is too difficult to juggle around
all the optional items. This is no doubt bad for translation, but I
don't expect there will ever be translations...

Take the opportunity to reuse a StringBuilder to avoid extra allocations
when the View is reused in a list.

Also apply the same fixes to the long details text and fix the plural
strings for ups and downs.

This also introduces a new Sessions table to experiment with a new
approach toward handling database data. The idea so far is that the
fragments and adapters should have no idea that sessions exist, because
that is the responsibility of the provider's underlying implementation.

This fixes the thing pager being empty in landscape mode. A previous
hack to reset the ThingPager in a separate runnable was erasing the
pager. The approach in this change expands an existing method to
setup the thing pager in one transaction. This also means pressing back
will go back to the calling application which is nice. The remaining
problem with the up button doing nothing in this case will be revisited
in issue #134.
