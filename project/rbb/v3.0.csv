Recognize indented lines and make them code blocks. This creates a new
TypefaceSpan for each line, so it could be improved to apply only a
single span for multiple lines to avoid allocating unnecessary memory.

Furthermore, the Formatter will still apply formatting to the content
that was placed in a code block.

These two issues need to be fixed before marking this issue as fixed.

Add the ability to touch and drag views sideways. This code merges some
fixes gleamed from Roman Nurik's swipable views gist. Specically, I
couldn't figure out to send the cancel event to disable items from
highlighting and long press from activating. I also added some code to
use the Y movement to decide whether or not to activate swiping. Anyhow,
this code doesn't dismiss anything yet. That will be addressed in a bevy
of other changes...

Also set the chosen state on views when clicking on them. Somehow
calling the ListView#onTouchEvent in the touch listener causes the views
to refresh too early and miss the drawable state change.
