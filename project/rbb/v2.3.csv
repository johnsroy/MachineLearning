thumbnail.

The code invalidated the entire view when setting a thumbnail. Change it
to only invalidate the thumbnail region to draw less while thumbnails
load as the user is scrolling.

Also fix a bug where the thumbnails weren't scaling properly. Make
thumbnails scale completely to the square even if they don't have the
height to do so. They look a bit stretched sometimes, but I think the
overall appearance of a full thumbnail looks better...
