Added ability to export favorites list as text. Available under the
Advanced settings. Exports in a format like this:
```
627 - Tech Support Cheat Sheet
641 - Free
645 - RPS
675 - Revolutionary
688 - Self-Description
```

The user can choose any app to export to that supports text/plain, such
as Gmail or a note-taking app.

Note that my computer and phone are not set up for Android development,
so I haven't tested or even compiled this, but it's a pretty simple
feature and hopefully I have done everything right. I used google
translate to add new text to the other languages, but I cannot vouch for
their accuracy.

Owner asked for the localization files to have the new strings written
in English so that the translators can find the new strings and
translate them accurately.
