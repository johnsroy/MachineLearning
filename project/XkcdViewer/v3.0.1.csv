"5cfce0cd0180ed7dc3e5c1e9bbc23dd0af14948c","2011-06-09 23:45:52+01:00","Add a preference for disabling zoom buttons (without affecting presence of pinch-zoom; there's already a preference for that one). There's no elegant way to hide the zoom buttons when using the WebView's builtin pinch-zoom, so in our hacked WebView subclass (which I've renamed ClickableWebView -> HackedWebView because it is no longer just to make it clickable), I've done some evil stuff with enabling/disabling zoom based on how many pointers are down! (Also pulled out the SDK int querying and isIncredible into a separate class so users of these don't need to reference XkcdViewerActivity.) Closes #45. Phew!
