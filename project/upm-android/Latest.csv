There have been a number of incidents where the database file has been
corrupted for no apparent reason. One potential cause is write thread
been interrupted (by an incoming call for example).

This change is an attempt to protect against such interruptions. Rather
than writing directly to the database file UPM now writes to a tmp file
and then renames this file to the actual db file name.
