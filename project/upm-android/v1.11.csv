When the device is rotated the EnterMasterPassword activity
is destroyed and a new instance created. The problem with the
old code was that it didn't recreate the ProgressDialog.
Subsequently, when the Async task finished an error was raised
when it tried to dismiss the dialog.

This fix manages the progress dialog lifecycle and ensures it's
destroyed and recreated in paralell with it's parent activity.

Inspiration for this fix came from,

If the AddEditActivity is in the foreground, UPM is sent to the background,
UPM's process is terminated, UPM is brought back to the foreground, the
AddEditAccount was throwing an NPE because the database no longer existed.

This fix opens the EnterMasterPassword activity from within onResume()
if the db is null.
