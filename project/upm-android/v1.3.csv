I think the problem was that the temp file being written to (with File.createTempFile()) was being deleted by the system before I had a chance to operate on it. The temp file idea is unnecessary anyway since the bytes are already i memory. The fix involves using the in memory bytes rather than going though a temp file.

The cause was as follows...
1. UPM is started
2. Password is entered and FullAccountList is displayed
3. Application is sent to the background
4. Android kills the UPM process due to lack of resources
5. UPM is started again
6. Android knowing that it was on FullAccountList last time it was running starts that activity
7. FullAccountList sees that the database is null so returns to EnterMasterPassword
8. User enters password
9. The static variable EnterMasterPassword.databaseFileToDecrypt is referenced but this variable is null since it's set from within AppEntryActivity and won't have been set since the process was restarted

The problem was that if the activity had being recreated the account instance variable was null.
