Previously, if one when adding a new transaction were to select
a budget option and capture a receipt the budget option was
reset. This is because the budget spinner was reset. To prevent
this, only reset the budget spinner if it currently is empty.

On Android 6.0+ devices the Camera permission must be requested
at runtime. Without this, if the application does not have
the permission but attempts to use the Camera a crash occurs.

To avoid this, request the camera permission, and if provided,
capture a receipt.
