If the ListView height was set to wrap_content, potentially
many views will be bound while loading. In practice it was
observed ~130 views were bound, when only several were displayed
at a time.

To reduce the number of views bound when loading, setting the
the height to the parent has the result of reducing the number
of views needed at a time, and half of the views are now
bound while loading.

The editing of the budget may result in its deletion.
To avoid attempting to load a budget that does not
exist, do not plan on viewing the budget after editing
it.

Further, the expected use case is to transition back
to the budget list anyway, so viewing the budget again
after editing was unnecessary.
