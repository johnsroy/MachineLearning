When a transaction or budget was selected for viewing the keyboard
would appear even though no field was editable. This change prevents
the keyboard from appearing.

Previously the widget would attempt to bring the
TransactionViewActivity to the front if it exists.
However, this may be in the state of viewing a transaction
or attempting to add a revenue. In these cases, the widget
did not bring up the add expense view which was expected.

As the widget is expected to only bring up a single-purpose
dialog, use the new task and multiple task flags. This will
result in launching the TransactionViewActivity in its own
task, and once complete will return to the home screen.

We will need to know when the transactions database changes
in the future. This commit sends out an intent whenever
the transactions database has an addition, update, or
removal.

In the past whenever the transaction fragment was resumed
it would reload the list of transactions. If one were scrolled
through the list, it would reset to the top. This change
installs a listener to determine if the fragment needs to be
reset.
