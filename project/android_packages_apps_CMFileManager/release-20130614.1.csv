* Replace mv command for a 'mv or cp+rm' operation.
* rm operation occurs over source mount point so this need to be mounted prior to execute this
new command.
* Fix the stderr buffer filling on error.

This change enabled the theme support, and added a new dark theme under the package
CMFileManagerThemes. To compile under build system, it must be enabled in
vendor/cm/config/common.mk or vendor/cm/config/themes_common.mk (this was
requested in change http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/c/26311/)

Themes were enabled in a new settings option. Under this setting the application
show the user the available themes installed in the system.

--------------------

For build new themes, developers should:

- Create a new package that contains an activity with:
* Permission: com.cyanogenmod.filemanager.permissions.READ_THEME
* Action: com.cyanogenmod.filemanager.actions.MAIN_THEME
* Category: com.cyanogenmod.filemanager.categories.THEME
- Define the themes_ids, themes_names and themes_descriptions arrays-strings
definitions for the themes that the package support.
- Create a xxx_theme.xml for every theme that the package support, where the
xxx is the id of the theme. Put your resources in this file, prefixing the
resource with the id of the theme (xxx_). For a list of all supported
resources see theme.xml in res/values of CMFileManager project.

-------------------

Other fixes:

* Protect console buffers from NPE
* Fix code style of xmls (layouts, drawables, ...)

Patchset 2: Fixed code style and added Christian suggestion
Patchset 3: Added forgotten READ_THEME permission check as described in the
note above.

* Move common file operations to FileHelper
* MoveCommand: As shell console, java console doesn't allow to move between filesystems. Use

Issue: http://code.google.com/p/cyanogenmod/issues/detail?id=6606

This patch makes the next changes:

* Make the internal editor exportable. Now it can be treated as another activity and can be mark
as preferred activity, but only for text/* and some text mime/types. For undefined mime/types
categories, the internal editor is still used in a non preferred mode (internal editor cannot
be marked as preferred)
* When the internal editor in a non preferred mode is selected, 'remember' checkbox is hidden.
* Improve preferred activity resolution
* Allow clear a preferred activity on the open with dialog (when 'remember' checkbox is unchecked)
* For better compatibility, the internal editor now ignores the ACTION_EDIT action, so opened
files are always editables (with the exception of binary files that they are opened always as
read-only)
* Improved onIntentSelected with better NPE and internal editor checks

On back navigation, replace the selection data parcelable info with the current selection

Added notifyDataSetChanged() when toogle visibility, needed to refresh the view and repaint

* Some performance improvements:
- Use stat instead of ls. This allow improve listing of directories with
symlinks. Symlinks are resolved by File.getCanonicalFile.
- Simplify ls, fileinfo, find and readlink command
- Simplify the parsing of FolderUsage (only type, size and category is
required), and avoid to load a lot of on unused objects
- Add new file datetime information from stat: access, change and modify
- Improve list, find and resolvelink java commands
* FadeEffect and symlink handling
* Remove context from AIDHelper and add new helpful methods
* New getAbsolutePath method
* Use file separator for paths and ROOT_DIRECTORY for root directory path
* Organize startup
- Initialize variables prior to register receivers
- Load AID data for improve performance through caching
- Load the theme base used by AOSP widgets
* Allow Editor to show zero-length files
Allow the editor to load zero-length files (like /proc/mounts) and
change the buffer type to no editable in binary files.
* Invert allowed mount points detection.
This change inverts the algorithm for prevent unmount needed rw
filesystems. Now uses known restricted filesystems instead of known
allowed filesystems. Now filesystems like yaffs2, fuse, and other linux
filesystems are allowed by default.
* Remove unused xliff namespace
* Add flagNoFullscreen to EditText widgets
* Fix listview selectors of history and bookmarks
* Fix race condition
When the command was executed prior to block the execution, the thread
wait for the timeout. Add a sync access check to ensure that prior to
lock and wait the program executed is not finished.
* Fix for async programs
When the partial buffer received for an async program is not complete
(ends with a EOL), the partial buffer was discarded. Add a new buffer
with this lost chars to complete this bytes next time
* Fix list command
Use -n1 for xargs in list command to prevent 'argument line too long'
* If parent is null then assume that it is the root folder
* Use only name and parent for equals method on FileSystemObject
A FileSystemObject is the same if his name and path are the same.
* Increase performance of adapters
Use argument data when possible to avoid call the adapter methods
* Do not clear selection on some actions
Actions like create new file/folder, show properties and other actions
that explicit requires clear the active selection, shouldn't removed the
active selection.
* Add a new additional line to dialog messages to fill the dialog
* Fix spanish translations
* Fix theme roulette on tablets
* Clean NLS and Override warnings
* Fix parse size data with dots
* Add listeners after set the values to avoid raising triggers
* Increase performance of adapters.
Notify the data changed at the end of the changes, and only to super
adapters (the internal structure has already been updated)
* Ensure that all the Cursor references were closed after used them.
* Remove unused SuppressLint
* Clean up

This is used e.g. by k-9 to select an attachment storage path.

There are a number of intent filter conventions for picking directories.
In k-9's code I found the following:

- action org.openintents.action.PICK_DIRECTORY, scheme file
- action com.estrongs.action.PICK_DIRECTORY, scheme file
- action Intent.ACTION_PICK, scheme folder
- action com.androidworkz.action.PICK_DIRECTORY, scheme file

Implemented is the third variant, as it's the most generic way to
describe the intention.
