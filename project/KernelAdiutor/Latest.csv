Once MainActivity is closed upon calling finish(), the AlertDialog is
not dismissed yet and thus causes a memory leak.

Fix this by dismissing the AlertDialog before closing MainActivity.

Adds support for a simple 0/1 attribute at
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/override_vmin.  When enabled on
kernels that support it, this attribute forces CPU voltage to remain
above a safe limit.

This commit also bolts a setFullSpan method onto SwitchCompatCardItem to
allow the override_vmin card to display correctly in the CPU Voltage
fragment.

Option for soft reboot/hot reboot by killing zygote. All the services and apps registered to zygote gets killed and restarted. This effectively decreases reboot time when someone just wants to restart all the apps. The effect is mostly noticeable on older devices.

Busybox is required for pkill/killall commands.

A kernel patch by franciscofranco also enables the ability to

various kernels. This does not break the old parameter or anything new.
This also closes #195.

[v2]: Simplify code and squash. 1 = y.
