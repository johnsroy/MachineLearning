The two receivers that are still exported, GoogleVoiceReceiver and SmsReceiver,
must be exported, as otherwise the broadcasts are not received by them.

Because the target SDK version is Jelly Bean but the minimum SDK version is
Donut, all APIs deprecated in JB throw warnings, but some of them have no
alternatives that are available in Donut.

The Notification API used in NotificationHandler is replaced by
Notification.Builder in Honeycomb, and the Preference API used in
PreferencesActivity is replaced by PreferenceFragment, also in Honeycomb.

This also required some tweaks to make RemoteRingActivity more generic, so it
can support both the page and ring functions so there's no code duplication.
At some point, RemoteRingActivity should probably be refactored to another name.

Part way through the pager functionality development, I decided against
labeling it as an emergency pager, just in case it failed to activate in
response to a message, the message never got to the device, or something else.
The pager functionality is a 'best effort' mechanism, and should be treated as
such.
