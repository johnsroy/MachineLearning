User feedback indicated some confusion about the red arcs, because they
associated red with disabled. Hence, the red arc icon now is used for the
disabled icon and the new green arc icon is used for the enabled icon.

Also, this fixed another emulator-only bug where multiple rings could take place
at once. This happened because 'ringtone' was always null in the event that a
ringtone could not be found. As there is now a different way to see if a ring is
happening, this bug is fixed.

Sorry about this frankly huge patch, but I didn't want to commit a half-baked
schema and have to change it several times before the next release. This schema
should need very few changes, though it hopefully doesn't need any at all.
