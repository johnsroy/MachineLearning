Unfortunately, some third-party SMS apps (namely GO SMS Pro) set the
priority of their SMS_RECEIVED handler very high, then abort the
broadcast. This prevents RDD from ever getting the SMS. With GSP, the
issue can be worked around by unchecking the 'Disable other message
notifications' setting, but that causes GSP to not abort the broadcast,
meaning the stock Messaging app will receive the message (ergo the user
will be notified twice). As much as I don't want to participate in the
battle of ever-rising priorities, the users of this app have requested
RDD work around GSP's high priority.

This version adds a workaround for third-party apps preventing RDD from
receiving SMS messages and removes some debug logging that is no longer
needed.
