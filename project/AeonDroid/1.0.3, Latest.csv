This will be useful when writing the code to check the alerts and to optimize the checking of the planetary hours.

"19a08acef2257152bd8be3e5698fffd3ba4dceb6","2015-10-03 15:54:57-07:00","QoL update: Only call ZoneTab when GPS location, manual location, and birth location change. The former was already done. The latter two was done every time the application started up instead of if and only if when the location changed in the settings. This fixes that. Also, this update makes the datetime widget for the EditTriggerActivity reference the current location or the GPS detected location instead of the birth location.

Also, update the function that makes moon phase objects to be independent of the full moon for reliability and decoupling purposes.

Also move the current chart variable onto the service, since we will need that once the trigger checking is integrated into the UI.

Finally, also make use of SunsetSunriseInfo's quick hour number calculation since that's faster than traversing through a list to check for the hours. As a consequence, the planetary hours widget should reconstruct the planetary hours from the ssi info if it's reading it off the service.

That's because the triggers are still WIP, mostly due to working on the trigger testing.
