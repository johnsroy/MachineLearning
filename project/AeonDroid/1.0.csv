Because of this, the architecture of the app was reworked a bit so any broadcast
receivers the fragments may have are registered and unregistered by the activity
hosting them. The activity's onResume() gets called before any of the
fragments' onResume()s.

Also with this update is rebasing the data adapters on BaseAdapter to avoid
duplicate copies of the calculated data in RAM (since ArrayAdapters use
their own storage backing).

The final notable change in this commit is moving where planetary icons
are retrieved to the themes themselves and just having the adapter resolve
the necessary themable attribute.

The reason why this is done is that due to the service running in the background, it won't fire off the refresh hours when bound back to in the GUI if it's during the middle of the night or something (it's hard to catch, but I was able to reproduce it with the debugger).  Thus, PHFragment's pha property would remain null until the next planetary hours refresh.

The GUI will manually send a refresh so the fragments can be updated on first launch.when the GUI starts to cover this rare case.

lways do it in local time rather than UTC. This way, the target hour is always at noon for
the target location. We also encompass the generation of getting sunrise, sunset, and
next sunrise into its own object so we can easily edit the logic for getting
the rising and setting times.

Furthermore, there seems to be some odd behavior with retrieving the body
rising and setting times in the Java library for swisseph. It seems a
little more unstable getting sunset.
