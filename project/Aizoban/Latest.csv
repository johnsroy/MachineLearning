Ran the 'drawable-nodpi', 'drawable-xhdpi' and 'drawable-xxhdpi' images
through tinypng.com - a lossy file compressor. Other folders weren't run
through because they only led to ~15% gains as they were already small
in size (compared to ~50% gains on these folders).
Smaller file sizes, should make for a somewhat smaller apk. I don't see
any change in visual quality but I'm committing to a new branch just in
case.
