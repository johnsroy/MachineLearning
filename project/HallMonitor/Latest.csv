- Title bar now will not appear for a short period of time when user close the cover

Testing the new layout
- Slighty increased default_content size
- Notification bar is at the top of the screen, like the status bar
- Increased size of default_widget_area, widgets 4x1 works fine, and some 4x2 too
- Other small changes

Removed all flags in default activity, now Holo theme sets automatically the flags, and thanks to this HallMonitor is much more smoother and faster when closing the cover.
Added a new layout
Widgets now works fine (only in new layout)

TODO
Find a way to solve widget issue in the old layout
A better way to change layout (maybe with a preview?)
Other small changes

- Answer/Reject calls with swipe (Requires a lot of tuning, but works well) only on alternative layout for the moment

Changes:
- Now timertask stops when receiving an incoming call and restart when a button in pressed

Revert Previous Commit 6da7afe4aac93b574c0c2fc56b2f98158b7a496f
Does not work, but i discovered a strange thing: when using alernative layout incoming call screen works better than default layout,
and if there is a notification pending in the notification area incoming call screen works 90% times.
