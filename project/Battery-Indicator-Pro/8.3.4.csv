Widgets display as disconnected when Service is destroyed, prompting user to reopen it.  This resolves the issue of not being able to close when only phantom widgets are present, and it is more understandable to users when actual widgets are present, because it was never obvious why Close was disabled.

This is better user experience, as it fits better with the lack of a cancel button and the fact that all settings (in settings screens) are applied immediately.  It also fixes the issue with rotating the screen while the dialog is open.
