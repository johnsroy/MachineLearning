Switched to v13 support library and made API level 13 rather than 7 the new minimum (old version will still be served to older devices). Plan to upgrade to new permission model next.

"890316a92634ed56cc01cf38355b0c0cbba16b0b","2016-07-04 15:06:18-07:00","Target API level 24 (Android N) and rebuild with new build tools.  This allows system-layout notifications to update themselves when running on Android N.  This breaks the main Activity's theming, but I think I'd like to update that anyway.  Update version to 10.0.0(-dev), as the next release will be the first public release for both Android M and N (previous Marshmallow support never publically released).  Will be adding support for new permission model before release, as well as probably upgrading build system to Gradle and updating theme (at least by default) to a light one (which seems to happen, poorly, on Android N without meaning to).  And it's the beginning of full-time work on Darshan Computing again, with better support of BatteryBot again.  Altogether, version 10.0.0 of app seems appropriate.
