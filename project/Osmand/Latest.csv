- define local.properties to locate the android sdk
- use 'ant nightbuild' to clean,update and upload the nightbuild

- the ant's ftp upload task needs commons-net.jar from apache on ant's classpath
- building may not work on windows where workspace path has spaces like 'C:\Program Files\' etc...

I noticed that sharing my position did not work properly. Instead of a
link to the position, there was a {0} and {1}. The MessageFormat did not
seem to work and because I couldn't get it working with MessageFormat, I
did it the way as the SaveDirectionsAsyncTask in MapActivityActions with
the getString(int, Object...) of mapActivity's parent.

As this change used a different format for replacements, I updated the
strings.xml too.

primary_link had a higher priority than primary for bicycle routing,
we surely want to avoid primary_link's when on a bike, so it should
be the same value at least.

Also primary had the same priority than trunk (which is very much
motorway-like, alas horrible for bicycles), adapt priorities a tad
so we prefer primaries over trunks. IMHO, we should rather decrease
the priorities of trunks and motorways further to make them less
attractive. Ever biked on a motorway?

Residential streets are usually a little quieter, so they should be
a little preferred over primary/secondary/tertiary streets.

Living_streets are quite similar to residential streets for bikes,
they should have the same priority and only be marginally slower.

We used the existing icon shop_diy for shop=hardware but not for shop=doityourself.
There are more than 20,000 dhop=doityourself out there.

I also re-ordered some shop rules to be alphabetical, but the only real
change is the use of icon='shop_diy' for shop=doityourself.

This addresses http://code.google.com/p/osmand/issues/detail?id=1405

When opening a location in certain apps (like WhatsApp) the value of q
in the called URI is something like 'loc:xx.xxxxxxx,x.xxxxxxx (Du) '.
Until now extract() expects 'xx.xxxxxxx,x.xxxxxxx' as input and cannot
parse URIs like the one above.

Solve this problem by cutting off unnessessary peaces of the URI.

It is dangerous to use (.*), because it matches several properties within the same line.
For example
'@drawable/(.*)'
matches
'@drawable/icon' android:label='@string/app_name'
thus android:label='@string/app_name' will be removed, leading to this issue:

To increase user privacy, especially with traffic that includes sensitive

Some networks require a proxy to get internet beyond the firewall, and

then it'll take them to the map.  Since the map will stay in the same task
as the original Activity where the user clicked it, the user is very likely
to be clicking on the back button.  Calling finish() here gives them one
less thing to click back on, since GeoIntentActivity will be removed.

This keeps the code consistent, provides a single common method for setting
up URLConnections, and allows the proxy support to work on all network
connections.

NetworkUtils.getHttpURLConnection() provides a common method for creating
HttpUrlConnection instances from URLs.  That's where the proxy config
happens.  If you can think of a better way to add proxy support, I'm all
ears.  This is the best that we've found in our proxy work at Guardian
Project.

this is a follow up on https://github.com/osmandapp/osmand/pull/1043

This is all of the possible Google Maps domains.  Unfortunately for this
case, Google redirects the .com to the country-specific domain of the
detection location of the user.  So if a user copies and pastes a map URL,
then it'll include that user's country domain.  So in order to support
catching Google Maps links well, the country domains need to be supported.

Update parseLength to be more strict and precise and also support inches when feet are specified. Inches are actually mandatory per the wiki, but not all mappers give them. The new function supports them when they are specified (so handles them as optional).

Sorry, I can't build OsmAnd so this patch is untested. Please try it out and then merge. Thanks.

each month we have users who cannot find places in offline address search because they do not press the button 'search villages/postcode' because instant search has no result for smaller places.

see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/osmand/IDm-pPb4IpI again.

So users need to know that this button does a further deeper search.

Alternatively add a text like 'Press above button when place name is not found instantly.'

I try to update sk/ttsconfig.p to support more of the existing features of voice commands. As there are several forms of plurals, I update the route times to be more different.

I still do not understand why in the phrase 'onto 'Market Square'', the internal command is 'street(p,'', '', 'Market Square')' (market square as 3rd argument to street()).
In the phrase 'onto 'Bridge Avenue'' the internal command is 'street(p, 'Bridge Avenue')' (Bridge avenue is first argument).
What is the difference? It seems to me the 2nd argument is road ref, first could be the street name. 3rd could be the destination (something a bit away, not current street/road). But these assumptions are not true at these commands, and also at the 'onto 'SR 80'' (it looks like a ref, but is used in 1st argument). So what are the rules?

Also I'd like if there was an example using e.g. bearLeft() including a street name. I don't know how the street name is used, in which context. Is it the street on which you should be keeping left, or is it the one where you get after you turn left (bearing on left before that)?

WHAT THIS PROVIDES:

A generic rendering/draw of GPX tracks that allows multiple 'renders' to be included as a part of the draw of any
TrkSegment. These 'renders' include the basic track drawing, but also other options such as dashed lines,
rainbow-coloured altitude indication, speed indication, arrows to point direction, animating 'lines' showing
direction of movement, and dots/text showing 1km (or any other) distances along tracks.  It's very extendable
and incredibly cheap in terms of procesisng speed.

For a view of some of these operating on this version of the code, see https://youtu.be/aRGCNLmBAlk

Additionally, all of the above have automatic asynchronous track resampling - either via line culling of
Ramer-Douglas-Peucer (implemented for the base track draw at different zooms), or an actual resampler that
takes a distance and steps off and creates a new track with points spaced exactly that distance apart along
the original track. The asynchronous resampling/culling willl automatically enable the new (optimal) track
display when the background task has completed.

This is completely up to date with the master branch as of an hour or so ago!

Two modified files
- GPXUtilities
Added some fields to WptPt to enable distance measurement on tracks and colouring for altitude/speed
- GPXLayer
Installed the new track rendering with examples (commented/out)

Two new files
- AsynchronousResampler.java
Implements line resampling and culling asynchrnonously for all line drawing
- Renderable.java
Set of classes for drawing different kinds of gpx 'renders'
- normal with automatic Ramer-Douglas-Peucer line culling
- conveyor-belt type animation of segments on a path
- altitude colouring of a path
- speed colouring of a path
- distance based waypoint/marker drawing

Just occurred to me that when zooming out (away) then the culled line we have is suitable for display. Previously when
zooming in or out, the culled line was discarded and the original line was drawn. That was to prevent you seeing really
low-resolution stuff while you wait for the asynchroous line cull to finish (can be in the order of several seconds).
However, with this modification, that is now only done when you are zooming in. This improves dramatically the 'busy'
look when too much stuff is drawn for the given resolution.  Anyway, simple fix but great effect.  :P

It's a lot simpler - and a lot faster, I'm sure.  Basically it didn't need to be as complex as it was, and mostly
the 'hard stuff' it was solving is actually fairly easily handled by the draw. So. Seems to be working fine.
There are other little tweaks here and there as I test out the system.
The renderers need to behave under density and zoom changes; so that would be the widths of things should scale
properly, and the look of some of them leave a bit to be desired. However, it's the system that is now fully
functional, and work on the renderers can come later.  The main track draw seems pretty solid.

Out of memory bug happened occasionally - now fixed by writing to original canvas instead of creating its own
bitmap buffer. It's going to be a lot quicker, too. Since the altitude band is now solid, though, it should be
in the renderer list before the standard track segment.

I have also done some work on the distance/marker renderer, and that is enabled in this update. It draws the
distance (km) as a marker and number over the top of each track.

I went for a ride on my motorbike today to check out how some of the changes work. The 'current track' stuff
is hopeless, so that needs to be fixed. Basically I was trying to NOT resample the current track, as it
causes all sorts of speed issues when points are continually added and resamples are continually fired. But
my change clearly didn't work properly so I will revisit that shortly.

I do urge anyone testing to try with a GPX track which has elevation data - the rainbow track backing is
quite nice I think... I hope others like it.

As a side note; I found out how to get the exception log - I have to setup an email account on my emulator
to get it to work.

The 'bounds' that I had implemeted earlier described the minimal rectangle inside which a whole track was contained. This
bounding rectangle was used to quickly cull all track types at draw-time. And it worked well... too well!  The current track
is continually adding points to itself, so its bounds need to be recalculated regularly, not just at startup like other
track types.

So, I've implemented a new Renderable, 'CurrentTrack' which does the special handling for that type of track. It is
smart in that it only recalculates/updates bounding rectangle on the newly added points, so it's very quick. I tested
it on my phone and it appears to be working OK.

Other minor adjustments here and there as I tweak things.

I got to thinking that the paint variable state should be preserved after the drawing functions did their stuff. Saving
and restoring individual values inside each function was getting messy, so I implemented a local paint variable which
was updated with the important stuff from the passed-in paints. The local variable is now used for all painting/drawing
and the original paint guaranteed unchanged. I could see issues elsewhere if I changed something and other code
was assuming it was already set.  So, quite a bit of fiddling with the code to get this working, but now it's clean.

I also did a bit of work on the arrows - see video at https://youtu.be/wvE9HUDMqSM

Basically they're much nicer, but also they are coloured. It's just an experimental thing, where the colour is based
upon the distance along the track; using the same rainbow scaling as the altitude display does; that is... purple up
to red.

A bit of inspiration; rather than trigger the culling for tracks when they are loaded and every time you zoom
(i.e, creating the resampled or simplified tracks such as standard track (Ramer Douglas Peucer line reduction), arrows,
speed, markers (all resample)... now the system uses the bounding rectangle of the original track to trigger the cull(s)
only when the track is onscreen and viewable. This now allows dozens of tracks to be loaded without initial slowdown
caused by all those resamplers and cullers running in the background. It's an on-demand system, in other words.

So, whereas previously if you had 20 GPX tracks loaded, and you zoomed in/out, then all 20 of those tracks would start
a Ramer-Douglas-Peucer resize, which would significantly slow down the whole thing (even though they are asynchronous
they do take a toll on performance).  Now, when you zoom in/out, only visible tracks (or ones which become visible)
will start the RDP resize.

By enabling on-zoom resampling of arrows, speed, altitude and conveyor data it is possible to more effectively
tailor the visuals of these renderers. For example, the altitude and speed are point-reduced based on zoom, and now
look much cleaner at low zoom values.  Likewise, the arrows are now rendered at consistent size regardless of
zoom. Also, the conveyor segments are similar length onscreen regardless of zoom. During a zoom change, the
prevoiusly resampled track is killed, so there is a brief flash while the appropriate track is resampled. This
appeared visually better than drawing the old track with incorrect spacing/scaling.

In the drawing loop, culling was performed on pixel boundaries based on x/y positions compared to the tileBox x/y position,
however calculating these from lat/lon was quite a slow process involving calls to getPixXFromLatLon and getPixYFromLatLon
which in turn had a horrendous amount of calculations happening. But since the tileBox has lat/lon and the pixel/lines being
drawn also have lat/lon it seems reasonable - despite potential spherical issues on lat/lon coordinates (?) to just use the
lat/lon as a visibility cull. So, that's what I've done and it does seem to work OK.  Heaps faster; aside from the actual
line draw we're talking a couple orders of magnitude improvement in speed.  Getting really zippy now, even when drawing
groups super big tracks, and I mean big - hundredsof thousands of points big.

The video at https://youtu.be/J1ppW3_hWds shows well over a thousand kilometers of tracks, 230 thousand points.

Before this change, GPX tracks are not shown in 'My Tracks' in 'My Places'
unless they have a lowercase .gpx extension.

Such tracks are still shown in 'Configure map', 'GPX track...' but the
extension isn't removed like it is for tracks with a lowercase extension.
This has been fixed too.

When reaching your destination in OsmAnd, the context menu shows a 'find
parking' button to help you find a parking space. This might be useful if
you're driving (or using an application mode derived from car) but isn't
useful if you've just walked up to the top of a hill or you're cycling.

With this change, the button is shown only if you've reached the
destination by car (or a car-derived mode).

On dependency changes in File -> Project structure... I get following errors (for 3 projects):

{% for project in ['Osmand', 'Osmand-SRTMPlugin', 'Osmand-ParkingPlugin'] %}
Module '{{ project }}'

'~/osmand/android/plugins/{{ project }}/src'.
The root already belongs to module '{{ project }}'

This is due duplicate lines in '{{ project }}.iml' file that is

This commit fixes this situation.

GPX distinguishes between routes (where you should go) and tracks (where
you've been).

OsmAnd can already use a colour specified in <color> in <extensions> for
tracks, but not routes.

With this change, OsmAnd uses colour specified in GPX files for routes.
This is very useful when viewing multiple routes or to emphasise a
particular route.
