sense, I'll admit that. Finding an optimal font size is not that simple
IMHO, when you need to render schedules with silly-long names and/or
silly-short slots.

But OK. Just default to showing ~3 lines in a block and offer a setting
for larger fonts or a static font size so people can get mostly the old
behaviour back. I hope this helps..

Also, figured out how to get the settings menu to show the current value
for each setting.

a fling which somehow gets the outer HScrollView to call scrollTo() with
what it thinks are the current coordinates (so with y=0). :-(
Working around this by making scrollTo() while we're in super.onLayout()
which I hope will be sufficient..
