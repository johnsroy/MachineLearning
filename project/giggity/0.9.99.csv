Giggity on old phones but 0.9.9 should be fine for them - the Android Market
lets me publish APKs for specific API versions so Giggity will continue to
be installable for them.

Also bumping target version to 14 (ICS) which makes the app look a little
more current on >=Honeycomb devices. Also it seems that some newer devices
omit old API version apps from the Market or even refuse to install them;
maybe this will fix that.

opened successfully, the database is cached, so you can call this method
every time you need to write to the database.' on

matters for me.. :-/

Hopefully this is finally robust. This code has been *disastrous*.
