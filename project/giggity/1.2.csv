instead. (So that's a new dependency.)

TeeReader was silly because it was at the character reader/writer level
instead of byte-level. I'll refactor Fetcher a little more so it can
support non-text.

downloaded and viewed locally instead of in the browser. Handy for PDFs and
easier on conference WiFi.

Note that this will cache things forever as it is now. I can/should probably
fix that at some point.

shot. (Helps if the venue is in Maps but that's not often the case yet.)
