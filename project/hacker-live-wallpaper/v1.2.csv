When the device is rotated, the sequences are recreated. However, the old
sequences were not cleared before adding the new ones to the list,
thus causing duplicate bit sequences. This will fix performance. Also, a
Vector was being used to store the sequences. Since synchronization is not
needed, this has been switched to a List for improved performance.

Previously, only the drawing of the BitSequences was paused when the wallpaper
was not visible. However, the BitSequence was still changing bits in the
background. This is now fixed, which should lead to a performance increase
