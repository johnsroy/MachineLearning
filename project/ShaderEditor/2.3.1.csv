It's probably more correct to reset the start time
whenever the surface changes. On Android < 5, this
means that showing or hiding the soft keyboard resets
the start time which is better.

Also moved onSurfaceChanged() before onDrawFrame()
because that is the order of execution.

Better because it doesn't require a static reference to
MainActivity.

Can't use setResult() to transfer fps, info log and the thumbnail
because going back from the preview will result in RESULT_CANCELLED
and data is null no matter if setResult() was run before.

Removed now unused static instance reference.

Reference to EditorFragment does not need to be static.

Reset static result members in PreviewActivity::onCreate().

Required to import textures on API < 19 from gallery apps
that do not use grantUriPermission(). Later API's will not
see that permission.

Hard decision. I don't really want to add that permission
but people (on API's < 19, especially Samsung devices)
keep running into this limitation and I just don't see a
better way to fix this.

At the time of writing, about 25% of installs will be
affected by this and will need to manually confirm the
update containing this change.
