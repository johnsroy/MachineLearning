To match the naming convention of all the other query
methods that return only one item. No reason to use
a different verb for bulk queries.

Got confused and thought the time uniform would contain
milliseconds when in fact it contains seconds. So I tried
to clarify what the constants actually mean and removed
that wrapping (because it would only wrap after ~18 hours).

Added Conway's Game of Life and a demo shader using the
gravity uniform.

Also, all samples will get inserted in database version 1
to make them available when updating.

Looks better but takes more code.

App's get judged by the looks, so let's go for it.

You need to touch the shader to see it working and
it's *very* slow on some devices. So it's probably
not a good sample.

Don't try to get a bigger image for a better quality
cut out because that breaks on some of my devices.
Apparently, 2048px can already be too much.
