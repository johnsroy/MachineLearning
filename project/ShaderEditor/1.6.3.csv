It's better to not save the view returned for R.id.fps because it's
impossible to know when Spinner does change the selected view; especially
when the adapter changes which may update the spinner not immediately.

Anyway, getSelectedView() and findViewById() are just lookups and this
method is only called every ShaderRenderer.FPS_UPDATE_FREQUENCY milliseconds
and if fps did actually change so that shoudln't be problem

At first, I don't need to call setText() to update the text. It's enough
to change the Editable.

the soft keyboard.

Second, don't use Editable.clearSpans() as it will remove too much.
Removing only the spans I added is enough.

If the texture frame buffer (backbuffer) is rendered first,
rendering to frame buffer 0 (the screen) next will result in
a flipped image (on the y axis).

Maybe that's because rendering into a texture is (by default?)
y-flipped because a textures origin (0/0) is always in the
bottom left. And maybe the transformation matrix does not get
reset on glBindFramebuffer( GL_FRAMEBUFFER, 0 ).

Anyway, rendering into frame buffer 0 first does fix the
problem.
