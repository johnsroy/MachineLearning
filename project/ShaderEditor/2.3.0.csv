Added a new uniform magnetic that exposes the geomagnetic
field strength along the x, y and z axis.

Because EditText draws the cursor before the background of
Spannables, an opaque background color will make the cursor
disappear. There's an issue about that:

https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=172001

For the time being, the simplest solution is to make the
background color transparent. It may not be as eye-catching
as before but it's probably still good enough to clearly see
where the error is.

Added missing sensors available down to minSdkVersion (API 9).

The proximity sensor very often only supports a binary 'near'
or 'far' measurement. The light sensor has very often only a
few levels too. And I guess many devices don't even have a
pressure sensor but anyway.

The mapping between uniform locations and texture IDs was missing.
And glActiveTexture() was missing. Bad.

Only create sensor listener objects if they're used.

Maybe they should even be null'ed in unregisterListeners()
to drop unrequired listeners when browsing between shaders.
