Originally put in Application because of error handling.
But since there's nothing that can be done if the database
would not open, it's probably better to put that where it
belongs.

Declaring the static members of the application context as
final is syntactically better because those members will
never change. The only reason they weren't final was, that
I preferred to make the objects only constructable with a
context object. Switched to late initialization because
it's probably more important to have the static members
to be final.
