Initial state is a few steps on from version 1.11.

Versions 1.11 and earlier have no method for detecting which versions
are being run in networked games. These versions will have too many
differences to later versions for them to be compatible.

This prevents earlier versions from networking with newer versions.

Doesn't increase file size very much at all.
Don't know to what extent armeabi devices can handle this game,
but might as well have the option.
Other architectures are probably much less important at this stage.

On slow phones it is very likely for the state to take too long
to be destroyed and for the graphics thread to try to draw the
state object in the middle of the destroy process.
This is fixed by making the global state pointer NULL before
calling delete on the state object, thereby allowing the graphics
thread to see that there is no valid state object.
