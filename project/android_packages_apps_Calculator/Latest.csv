Some languages, such as Spanish, localizes mathematical functions
('sen' for 'sin' in this example). The underlying arithmetic engine
doesn't understand the localized version so we need to delocalize
it before passing it to the engine.

Contextual menu of calculator on tablet devices shows 'basic' and 'advanced'
panels. This is completly unuseful because tablet layout contains both
of them in the same container. This also causes a crash when trying to
select one of this options from contextual menu.

Shortened 'DELETE' spanish translation so it fits to its place.

patchset 2: right headers on new menu for sw600dp
patchset 3: replaced string by global 'clear' used by physical calculators  ('CE')
