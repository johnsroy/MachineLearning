Prior to this, the hints were specified in the following format:
hintgroup somealias1 somealias2

Now, ptpb.pw offers outputting in either YAML or JSON. We chose JSON
since the Android SDK already has JSON parsing.

In detail:
- whereClause instances were refactored to use String.format to make it
clearer what fields are being queried. It also avoids hardcoding the
fields in case we need to change it in the future.
- naliases and maxName were the same in both instances of getHintGroups.
To avoid recreating these strings, they're declared as private static
final Strings on the class level.
- Avoid recreating the query that grabs the biggest hint group id

Currently, auto-refresh on enter is only additive. The manual refresh

- Formats control the file format the paste is rendered as. For
instance, specifying an rtf format will give you an rtf file you can
view in a word processor.
- Styles control the colorscheme the file is rendered with.

There are still a few minor usability issues with this, such as
indicating what the previous style/format was before we select a new one.
