- Remove the manual update Intent from the manifest, the sender from the
background service, and the receiver from the provider.  Turns out if
we're doing this right we don't need it. :)
- Major revamp of the RemoteViewsAdapter (aka NWSWidgetService)
- Removed the commented out code for the old Handler() we aren't using
anymore
- Replace it with synchronize() locks around calls to the data that
wasn't thread-safe to mess with. We need to block to access that data
instead of posting a 'run it later in the same thread when we have spare
cycles' routine.
- Removed the TODO annotations from auto-generated stubs that have
been verified to return what they're supposed to return.
- And the major bugfix: in onDataSetChanged() the docs say we're
allowed to block until the data we need is available, so do so, and wait
for the IPC connection to connect before attempting to grab the data and
returning.

Overall, watching the log, this not only gets rid of the blank 'loading'
for long periods of time but also makes initial widget startup a lot
cleaner.
