- add an empty view on the widget so you can see it when it hasn't
loaded yet
- add a click handler on the in-app list to launch the 'more info' URL
for the alert in the browser
- override updateAppWidget in the WidgetProvider to throw it a complete
copy of the views on updates (hopefully should stop it from disappearing
after it's been running for a while)
- shorten the initial run timer on the main view so the list will show
up faster after it's available
- attempt to make the default widget size 3 x 1 instead of 2 x 1
- add a shadow/glow to the text in the list items so it'll be readable
even on the gradient backgrounds.

The trick was to call appWidgetManager.notifyAppWidgetViewDataChanged
directly from the widgetService instead of sending an Intent to the
Provider class to do it.
appWidgetManager.notifyAppWidgetViewDataChanged is actually the ONLY
thing that needed calling, the views didn't all need rebuilding, too.

- gen_nws_counties_xml.pl scrapes the NWS website and grabs the URLS for
every state, territory, district, and zone that the NWS supports and
generates the XML files for the preferences. I was originally going to
have it fetch the counties at runtime when the user picked a state, but
the tech at the NWS that I was communicating with about writing this
said they'll never change, so just hardcode them in the app.  On the off
chance they ever do change, just run this script and rebuild to pick up
the changes.

reconnecting to the background service - based on the logs this seems to
be where it's getting lost.  Backend restarts, it sends a 'rebuild
everything' intent out, the widget fires up the remote views service,
which then tries to connect to the background service to fetch the data.
Widget then polls the service for that data before the connection is
made, gets nothing, and draws a blank widget.  So the fix is to re-issue
the 'rebuild everything' intent again from the remote views service
after it has the connection to the background service open and ready to
serve data again.
