Since its true inception (i.e., version 3), ActionBarSherlock has had one major criticism that created a reluctance for a lot of people to leverage it in their apps: its internalization and modification of the Google support library (compatibility package). This was deemed necessary since there is no reliable external way to dispatch anything to attached and visible fragments.

With this commit we introduce a new set of base classes which exist independent of the support library (and extend from it) in order to progressively add the action bar functionality.

* `SherlockFragmentActivity` replaces `FragmentActivity` and has the job of marshalling our ABS menu classes into native wrappers which can be dispatched along the normal menu callbacks and thus into the appropriate fragments.
* `SherlockFragment` (and `SherlockListFragment and `SherlockDialogFragment`) replace `Fragment` and unwrap the menu instances dispatched through the fragment manager so that we can use the ABS menu classes in new callbacks. The regular menu callbacks are finalized just like their activity counterparts so that only the correct ones can be overriden.

The original Galaxy Tab, however, is a large, hdpi, 1024x600 device. Since the scaling that would occur from the above configuration being picked up creates overly large bars we scale its configuration back down to the normal 48dp/40dp.

1. When dispatching manually to the superclass onCreatePanelMenu it
ends up calling onCreateOptionsMenu again. In order to not
erroneously return true when the application activity returned
false we use an override Boolean to return the same value as our
sherlock version.
2. On pre-Honeycomb the implementation will always return `true`
since it originally was designed with its own menu support. Since
we are doing everything ourselves this value can cause incorrect
results. Instead, use a boolean from the menu which indicates
whether or not it has any visible menu items. This *should* be
exactly the same value that would be returned post-Honeycomb.

The implementation of onTabSelected() uses the instance variable
mFragmentTransaction, which is hand over to the listeners
onTabSelected(). At the start of an Activity, which uses a TabListener
a NullPointerException is thrown, because the FragmentTransaction is
null. The only point where a FragmentTransaction is assigned to
mFragmentTransaction is onTabUnselected().

I guess the intended behavior is that the transaction created in
onTabUnselected() is used in onTabSelected() afterwards and the
detaching/attaching is done in the same transaction (because
onTabUnselected() doesn't call commit on the transaction itself).

However at the start just onTabSelected() is called and not
onTabUnselected(), because there was nothing selected before. So
mFragmentTransaction is null and the Exception is thrown. I added an
if-check to  receive the FragmentTransaction the same way
onTabUnselected() does, when mFragmentTransaction is null.
