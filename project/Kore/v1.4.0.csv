"611dafc10189e8f863585fdeebd58904dc3dd0fa","2015-04-08 22:28:19+01:00","Add new intent to 'Play on Kodi'. This allows sharing videos from the YouTube app to Kodi (unfortunately the share option will appear in every app that shares plain text links, as that is what the YouTube app shares).
Tweaked the Now Playing and Playlist screens to better support YouTube videos
Changed HostConnectionObserver to notify clients not only when the id of what's playing changes but also when the label changes (YouTube videos and pictures for instance don't have ids, so the remote wasn't getting notified of a change in what's playing)

Defined playlist types in the correct place

"30b4ac763a6d0b78b4ea39689ad1684dbdfe607a","2015-04-11 17:58:15+01:00","Allow the user to specify the protocol to use in the connection (TCP/HTTP). HTTP is always needed/used (for images and some requests where TCP can't be used because we want to be stateless), TCP is used by default and if available, but now the user can explicitly choose not to use TCP and always go through HTTP.
