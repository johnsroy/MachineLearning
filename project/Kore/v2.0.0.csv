Implemented context menus in GridView items in AlbumListFragment,
ArtistListFragment and AudioGenreListFragment.
This allows the user to add everything from an artist, album, or
genre by popping up the context menu and selecting either play
or Add to playlist.

Created a new class utils/MediaManager to hold any methods related
to managing media. Added methods play(...) and queueAudio(...) to
add musiclist items to the current playlist and start playing.

Long album titles are ellipsed but TextView width was set to match parent's
width. This caused the TextView to take up all available width instead leaving
some for the context menu. Fix this by explicitly telling the TextViews to
be placed left of the context menu image.

Implemented binding to LibrarySyncService to check if there are items currently
syncing or queued to sync. This makes it possible to inform user of background
sync processes.

Created two abstract classes to reduce code duplication and check if
LibrarySyncService has any items queued which are currently being displayed.

Fixed issue with SwipeRefreshLayout from appcompat library, which does not
always show the refresh animation when refresh is set to true.

I removed using the poster as fanart if no fanart is available.
The reason is that the shared element transition is not very smooth
when the aspect ratio of the two image states is not the same.
Going from AlbumListFragment to AlbumDetailsFragment the poster
is resized correctly to the fanart size. However, returning to the
AlbumListFragment from the AlbumDetailsFragment the poster is
abruptly resized to the square aspect ratio needed for the list
fragment.

"f84ccaf02a4fdee890a8e90e6e71caf4636de99c","2015-12-10 16:44:42+01:00","Implemented fix for movie and album shared element transitions

When shared element view is not visible on returning, the return shared
element transition starts off screen. This looks odd and we now simply
do not perform the shared element transition when the shared element is
not visible.
