blobs - specifically, either base64 decoded binary strings (password_hash/salt)
or pickled Python objects with their string fields base64 decoded (a la what
SJCL returns from encryption after conversion from JSON). Authentication now
works. Due to problems with SJCL/pickle, file retrieval currently doesn't work.
Problems:

1. base64 types weren't being buffered to the correct length. Fixed this with
two calls with the parameter false to base64.fromBits.
2. SJCL wasn't outputting quotes around keys in JSON (e.g. {a: 'b'} as opposed
to {'a': 'b'}). Fixed this with hacky regexps before Python's JSON decoder gets
a chance to see any shenanigans.
3. pickle seems to be unable to unpickle things it pickled. Needs more
investigation.
