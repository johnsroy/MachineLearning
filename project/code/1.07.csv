"7fcd54d1cb33b7d1fcc04cf5d73492cbe66df205","2010-01-18 02:21:16-08:00","Couple of things:
1. Independent updater/display thread periods.
2. Changed updater/display thread communication to use LinkedBlockingQueue
instead of notifications. This means updater thread is almost never blocked
on a display update leading to the holy grail: regular data point sampling!
3. Added Profiler class to gauge performance. Initial results: 70% of time
is spent fucking around drawing the awesome line, most of the rest is
background plus g.
4. Added a method to draw FPS to the screen. Let's just say recorded FPS
sucks.
5. Tons of shitty debug code is now everywhere, so removing that will make
things speedier.

1. Removed profiler/FPS code from SeismoViewThread.
2. Forced SeismoViewThread to wait to display until at least one new item needs
to be drawn (max FPS now == 30).
3. Moved some repeated allocations in inner SeismoViewThread drawing code to
class scope to avoid slamming the garbage collector.
4. Added some code to try to maintain thread state between activity switches.
So far, no good.

out the way to do this is to move state outside of Thread into View, which is
more work than it's worth at this point.
