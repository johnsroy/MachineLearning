seismograph. Current implementation just reads and prints accelerometer
direction.

now all UI is handled in one thread and data processing in another, I guess.

"863b26ebd7a4bdb36a74f66efcf86dcfc5fd76a4","2009-12-19 21:56:40-08:00","Actually measures accelerometer values! Not quite zeroed on x and y so I'm not
sure what's happening. But it does something! And doesn't crash. There's a
message-passing architecture now that I'm not sure is necessary and I have lots
of overrides on the Activity that do nothing but call the superclass. But it
works!

add a menu and I'll have a real app :).
