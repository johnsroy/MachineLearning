# MachineLearning
A Deep learning Project based on software Project Management.
Things to Look out for here:
1) Machine Learning Techniques: LDA, Cluster Analysis, K-Means, Decision Trees, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
2) Python libraries like gensim, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, scipy, pyLDAvis.
3) Several Data Analytics Techniques
4) Software Development Lifecycle Modelling
5) How to create new flexible Lifecycle Models based on project needs.
